      Some of these pages you have seen, some you have praised, one stands
      new-written because you blamed it; and all, my dear critic, beg leave to
      remind you of their author's changeless admiration.

    <h2>
      TO THE READER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Certain of the newspapers, when this book was first announced, made a
      mistake most natural upon seeing the sub-title as it then stood, A TALE OF
      SUNDRY ADVENTURES. &ldquo;This sounds like a historical novel,&rdquo; said one of
      them, meaning (I take it) a colonial romance. As it now stands, the title
      will scarce lead to such interpretation; yet none the less is this book
      historical&mdash;quite as much so as any colonial romance. Indeed, when
      you look at the root of the matter, it is a colonial romance. For Wyoming
      between 1874 and 1890 was a colony as wild as was Virginia one hundred
      years earlier. As wild, with a scantier population, and the same primitive
      joys and dangers. There were, to be sure, not so many Chippendale settees.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know quite well the common understanding of the term &ldquo;historical
      novel.&rdquo; HUGH WYNNE exactly fits it. But SILAS LAPHAM is a novel as
      perfectly historical as is Hugh Wynne, for it pictures an era and
      personifies a type. It matters not that in the one we find George
      Washington and in the other none save imaginary figures; else THE SCARLET
      LETTER were not historical. Nor does it matter that Dr. Mitchell did not
      live in the time of which he wrote, while Mr. Howells saw many Silas
      Laphams with his own eyes; else UNCLE TOM'S CABIN were not historical. Any
      narrative which presents faithfully a day and a generation is of necessity
      historical; and this one presents Wyoming between 1874 and 1890. Had you
      left New York or San Francisco at ten o'clock this morning, by noon the
      day after to-morrow you could step out at Cheyenne. There you would stand
      at the heart of the world that is the subject of my picture, yet you would
      look around you in vain for the reality. It is a vanished world. No
      journeys, save those which memory can take, will bring you to it now. The
      mountains are there, far and shining, and the sunlight, and the infinite
      earth, and the air that seems forever the true fountain of youth, but
      where is the buffalo, and the wild antelope, and where the horseman with
      his pasturing thousands? So like its old self does the sage-brush seem
      when revisited, that you wait for the horseman to appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he will never come again. He rides in his historic yesterday. You will
      no more see him gallop out of the unchanging silence than you will see
      Columbus on the unchanging sea come sailing from Palos with his caravels.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet the horseman is still so near our day that in some chapters of
      this book, which were published separate at the close of the nineteenth
      century, the present tense was used. It is true no longer. In those
      chapters it has been changed, and verbs like &ldquo;is&rdquo; and &ldquo;have&rdquo; now read
      &ldquo;was&rdquo; and &ldquo;had.&rdquo; Time has flowed faster than my ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is become of the horseman, the cow-puncher, the last romantic figure
      upon our soil? For he was romantic. Whatever he did, he did with his
      might. The bread that he earned was earned hard, the wages that he
      squandered were squandered hard,&mdash;half a year's pay sometimes gone in
      a night,&mdash;&ldquo;blown in,&rdquo; as he expressed it, or &ldquo;blowed in,&rdquo; to be
      perfectly accurate. Well, he will be here among us always, invisible,
      waiting his chance to live and play as he would like. His wild kind has
      been among us always, since the beginning: a young man with his
      temptations, a hero without wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cow-puncher's ungoverned hours did not unman him. If he gave his word,
      he kept it; Wall Street would have found him behind the times. Nor did he
      talk lewdly to women; Newport would have thought him old-fashioned. He and
      his brief epoch make a complete picture, for in themselves they were as
      complete as the pioneers of the land or the explorers of the sea. A
      transition has followed the horseman of the plains; a shapeless state, a
      condition of men and manners as unlovely as is that moment in the year
      when winter is gone and spring not come, and the face of Nature is ugly. I
      shall not dwell upon it here. Those who have seen it know well what I
      mean. Such transition was inevitable. Let us give thanks that it is but a
      transition, and not a finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes readers inquire, Did I know the Virginian? As well, I hope, as a
      father should know his son. And sometimes it is asked, Was such and such a
      thing true? Now to this I have the best answer in the world. Once a
      cow-puncher listened patiently while I read him a manuscript. It concerned
      an event upon an Indian reservation. &ldquo;Was that the Crow reservation?&rdquo; he
      inquired at the finish. I told him that it was no real reservation and no
      real event; and his face expressed displeasure. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;do
      you waste your time writing what never happened, when you know so many
      things that did happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I could no more help telling him that this was the highest compliment
      ever paid me than I have been able to help telling you about it here!

    <h2>
      I. ENTER THE MAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some notable sight was drawing the passengers, both men and women, to the
      window; and therefore I rose and crossed the car to see what it was. I saw
      near the track an enclosure, and round it some laughing men, and inside it
      some whirling dust, and amid the dust some horses, plunging, huddling, and
      dodging. They were cow ponies in a corral, and one of them would not be
      caught, no matter who threw the rope. We had plenty of time to watch this
      sport, for our train had stopped that the engine might take water at the
      tank before it pulled us up beside the station platform of Medicine Bow.
      We were also six hours late, and starving for entertainment. The pony in
      the corral was wise, and rapid of limb. Have you seen a skilful boxer
      watch his antagonist with a quiet, incessant eye? Such an eye as this did
      the pony keep upon whatever man took the rope. The man might pretend to
      look at the weather, which was fine; or he might affect earnest
      conversation with a bystander: it was bootless. The pony saw through it.
      No feint hoodwinked him. This animal was thoroughly a man of the world.
      His undistracted eye stayed fixed upon the dissembling foe, and the
      gravity of his horse-expression made the matter one of high comedy. Then
      the rope would sail out at him, but he was already elsewhere; and if
      horses laugh, gayety must have abounded in that corral. Sometimes the pony
      took a turn alone; next he had slid in a flash among his brothers, and the
      whole of them like a school of playful fish whipped round the corral,
      kicking up the fine dust, and (I take it) roaring with laughter. Through
      the window-glass of our Pullman the thud of their mischievous hoofs
      reached us, and the strong, humorous curses of the cow-boys. Then for the
      first time I noticed a man who sat on the high gate of the corral, looking
      on. For he now climbed down with the undulations of a tiger, smooth and
      easy, as if his muscles flowed beneath his skin. The others had all
      visibly whirled the rope, some of them even shoulder high. I did not see
      his arm lift or move. He appeared to hold the rope down low, by his leg.
      But like a sudden snake I saw the noose go out its length and fall true;
      and the thing was done. As the captured pony walked in with a sweet,
      church-door expression, our train moved slowly on to the station, and a
      passenger remarked, &ldquo;That man knows his business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the passenger's dissertation upon roping I was obliged to lose, for
      Medicine Bow was my station. I bade my fellow-travellers good-by, and
      descended, a stranger, into the great cattle land. And here in less than
      ten minutes I learned news which made me feel a stranger indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      My baggage was lost; it had not come on my train; it was adrift somewhere
      back in the two thousand miles that lay behind me. And by way of comfort,
      the baggage-man remarked that passengers often got astray from their
      trunks, but the trunks mostly found them after a while. Having offered me
      this encouragement, he turned whistling to his affairs and left me planted
      in the baggage-room at Medicine Bow. I stood deserted among crates and
      boxes, blankly holding my check, hungry and forlorn. I stared out through
      the door at the sky and the plains; but I did not see the antelope shining
      among the sage-brush, nor the great sunset light of Wyoming. Annoyance
      blinded my eyes to all things save my grievance: I saw only a lost trunk.
      And I was muttering half-aloud, &ldquo;What a forsaken hole this is!&rdquo; when
      suddenly from outside on the platform came a slow voice: &ldquo;Off to get
      married AGAIN? Oh, don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice was Southern and gentle and drawling; and a second voice came in
      immediate answer, cracked and querulous. &ldquo;It ain't again. Who says it's
      again? Who told you, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the first voice responded caressingly: &ldquo;Why, your Sunday clothes told
      me, Uncle Hughey. They are speakin' mighty loud o' nuptials.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't worry me!&rdquo; snapped Uncle Hughey, with shrill heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the other gently continued, &ldquo;Ain't them gloves the same yu' wore to
      your last weddin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't worry me! You don't worry me!&rdquo; now screamed Uncle Hughey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already I had forgotten my trunk; care had left me; I was aware of the
      sunset, and had no desire but for more of this conversation. For it
      resembled none that I had heard in my life so far. I stepped to the door
      and looked out upon the station platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lounging there at ease against the wall was a slim young giant, more
      beautiful than pictures. His broad, soft hat was pushed back; a
      loose-knotted, dull-scarlet handkerchief sagged from his throat; and one
      casual thumb was hooked in the cartridge-belt that slanted across his
      hips. He had plainly come many miles from somewhere across the vast
      horizon, as the dust upon him showed. His boots were white with it. His
      overalls were gray with it. The weather-beaten bloom of his face shone
      through it duskily, as the ripe peaches look upon their trees in a dry
      season. But no dinginess of travel or shabbiness of attire could tarnish
      the splendor that radiated from his youth and strength. The old man upon
      whose temper his remarks were doing such deadly work was combed and
      curried to a finish, a bridegroom swept and garnished; but alas for age!
      Had I been the bride, I should have taken the giant, dust and all. He had
      by no means done with the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yu've hung weddin' gyarments on every limb!&rdquo; he now drawled, with
      admiration. &ldquo;Who is the lucky lady this trip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man seemed to vibrate. &ldquo;Tell you there ain't been no other! Call
      me a Mormon, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me a Mormon? Then name some of my wives. Name two. Name one. Dare
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;that Laramie wido' promised you&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;only her doctor suddenly ordered Southern climate and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks! You're a false alarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;so nothing but her lungs came between you. And next you'd most got
      united with Cattle Kate, only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you you're a false alarm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;only she got hung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the wives in all this? Show the wives! Come now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That corn-fed biscuit-shooter at Rawlins yu' gave the canary&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never married her. Never did marry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yu' come so near, uncle! She was the one left yu' that letter
      explaining how she'd got married to a young cyard-player the very day
      before her ceremony with you was due, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you're nothing; you're a kid; you don't amount to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and how she'd never, never forgot to feed the canary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This country's getting full of kids,&rdquo; stated the old man, witheringly.
      &ldquo;It's doomed.&rdquo; This crushing assertion plainly satisfied him. And he
      blinked his eyes with renewed anticipation. His tall tormentor continued
      with a face of unchanging gravity, and a voice of gentle solicitude: &ldquo;How
      is the health of that unfortunate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right! Pour your insults! Pour 'em on a sick, afflicted woman!&rdquo;
       The eyes blinked with combative relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insults? Oh, no, Uncle Hughey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right! Insults goes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I was mighty relieved when she began to recover her mem'ry. Las'
      time I heard, they told me she'd got it pretty near all back. Remembered
      her father, and her mother, and her sisters and brothers, and her friends,
      and her happy childhood, and all her doin's except only your face. The
      boys was bettin' she'd get that far too, give her time. But I reckon afteh
      such a turrable sickness as she had, that would be expectin' most too
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Uncle Hughey jerked out a small parcel. &ldquo;Shows how much you know!&rdquo;
       he cackled. &ldquo;There! See that! That's my ring she sent me back, being too
      unstrung for marriage. So she don't remember me, don't she? Ha-ha! Always
      said you were a false alarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Southerner put more anxiety into his tone. &ldquo;And so you're a-takin' the
      ring right on to the next one!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, don't go to get married
      again, Uncle Hughey! What's the use o' being married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the use?&rdquo; echoed the bridegroom, with scorn. &ldquo;Hm! When you grow up
      you'll think different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course I expect to think different when my age is different. I'm havin'
      the thoughts proper to twenty-four, and you're havin' the thoughts proper
      to sixty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty!&rdquo; shrieked Uncle Hughey, jumping in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Southerner took a tone of self-reproach. &ldquo;Now, how could I forget you
      was fifty,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;when you have been telling it to the boys so
      careful for the last ten years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Have you ever seen a cockatoo&mdash;the white kind with the top-knot&mdash;enraged
      by insult? The bird erects every available feather upon its person. So did
      Uncle Hughey seem to swell, clothes, mustache, and woolly white beard; and
      without further speech he took himself on board the Eastbound train, which
      now arrived from its siding in time to deliver him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this was not why he had not gone away before. At any time he could
      have escaped into the baggage-room or withdrawn to a dignified distance
      until his train should come up. But the old man had evidently got a sort
      of joy from this teasing. He had reached that inevitable age when we are
      tickled to be linked with affairs of gallantry, no matter how.
    </p>
    <p>
      With him now the Eastbound departed slowly into that distance whence I had
      come. I stared after it as it went its way to the far shores of
      civilization. It grew small in the unending gulf of space, until all sign
      of its presence was gone save a faint skein of smoke against the evening
      sky. And now my lost trunk came back into my thoughts, and Medicine Bow
      seemed a lonely spot. A sort of ship had left me marooned in a foreign
      ocean; the Pullman was comfortably steaming home to port, while I&mdash;how
      was I to find Judge Henry's ranch? Where in this unfeatured wilderness was
      Sunk Creek? No creek or any water at all flowed here that I could
      perceive. My host had written he should meet me at the station and drive
      me to his ranch. This was all that I knew. He was not here. The
      baggage-man had not seen him lately. The ranch was almost certain to be
      too far to walk to, to-night. My trunk&mdash;I discovered myself still
      staring dolefully after the vanished East-bound; and at the same instant I
      became aware that the tall man was looking gravely at me,&mdash;as gravely
      as he had looked at Uncle Hughey throughout their remarkable conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see his eye thus fixing me and his thumb still hooked in his
      cartridge-belt, certain tales of travellers from these parts forced
      themselves disquietingly into my recollection. Now that Uncle Hughey was
      gone, was I to take his place and be, for instance, invited to dance on
      the platform to the music of shots nicely aimed?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I am looking for you, seh,&rdquo; the tall man now observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0005" id="link2H_4_0005">

    <h2>
      II. &ldquo;WHEN YOU CALL ME THAT, SMILE!&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      We cannot see ourselves as others see us, or I should know what appearance
      I cut at hearing this from the tall man. I said nothing, feeling
      uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I am looking for you, seh,&rdquo; he repeated politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am looking for Judge Henry,&rdquo; I now replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked toward me, and I saw that in inches he was not a giant. He was
      not more than six feet. It was Uncle Hughey that had made him seem to
      tower. But in his eye, in his face, in his step, in the whole man, there
      dominated a something potent to be felt, I should think, by man or woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Judge sent me afteh you, seh,&rdquo; he now explained, in his civil
      Southern voice; and he handed me a letter from my host. Had I not
      witnessed his facetious performances with Uncle Hughey, I should have
      judged him wholly ungifted with such powers. There was nothing external
      about him but what seemed the signs of a nature as grave as you could
      meet. But I had witnessed; and therefore supposing that I knew him in
      spite of his appearance, that I was, so to speak, in his secret and could
      give him a sort of wink, I adopted at once a method of easiness. It was so
      pleasant to be easy with a large stranger, who instead of shooting at your
      heels had very civilly handed you a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're from old Virginia, I take it?&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered slowly, &ldquo;Then you have taken it correct, seh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight chill passed over my easiness, but I went cheerily on with a
      further inquiry. &ldquo;Find many oddities out here like Uncle Hughey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, seh, there is a right smart of oddities around. They come in on
      every train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point I dropped my method of easiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish that trunks came on the train,&rdquo; said I. And I told him my
      predicament.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not to be expected that he would be greatly moved at my loss; but
      he took it with no comment whatever. &ldquo;We'll wait in town for it,&rdquo; said he,
      always perfectly civil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, what I had seen of &ldquo;town&rdquo; was, to my newly arrived eyes, altogether
      horrible. If I could possibly sleep at the Judge's ranch, I preferred to
      do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it too far to drive there to-night?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me in a puzzled manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For this valise,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;contains all that I immediately need; in
      fact, I could do without my trunk for a day or two, if it is not
      convenient to send. So if we could arrive there not too late by starting
      at once&mdash;&rdquo; I paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's two hundred and sixty-three miles,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my loud ejaculation he made no answer, but surveyed me a moment longer,
      and then said, &ldquo;Supper will be about ready now.&rdquo; He took my valise, and I
      followed his steps toward the eating-house in silence. I was dazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we went, I read my host's letter&mdash;a brief hospitable message. He
      was very sorry not to meet me himself. He had been getting ready to drive
      over, when the surveyor appeared and detained him. Therefore in his stead
      he was sending a trustworthy man to town, who would look after me and
      drive me over. They were looking forward to my visit with much pleasure.
      This was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I was dazed. How did they count distance in this country? You spoke
      in a neighborly fashion about driving over to town, and it meant&mdash;I
      did not know yet how many days. And what would be meant by the term
      &ldquo;dropping in,&rdquo; I wondered. And how many miles would be considered really
      far? I abstained from further questioning the &ldquo;trustworthy man.&rdquo; My
      questions had not fared excessively well. He did not propose making me
      dance, to be sure: that would scarcely be trustworthy. But neither did he
      propose to have me familiar with him. Why was this? What had I done to
      elicit that veiled and skilful sarcasm about oddities coming in on every
      train? Having been sent to look after me, he would do so, would even carry
      my valise; but I could not be jocular with him. This handsome,
      ungrammatical son of the soil had set between us the bar of his cold and
      perfect civility. No polished person could have done it better. What was
      the matter? I looked at him, and suddenly it came to me. If he had tried
      familiarity with me the first two minutes of our acquaintance, I should
      have resented it; by what right, then, had I tried it with him? It smacked
      of patronizing: on this occasion he had come off the better gentleman of
      the two. Here in flesh and blood was a truth which I had long believed in
      words, but never met before. The creature we call a GENTLEMAN lies deep in
      the hearts of thousands that are born without chance to master the outward
      graces of the type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the station and the eating-house I did a deal of straight
      thinking. But my thoughts were destined presently to be drowned in
      amazement at the rare personage into whose society fate had thrown me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Town, as they called it, pleased me the less, the longer I saw it. But
      until our language stretches itself and takes in a new word of closer fit,
      town will have to do for the name of such a place as was Medicine Bow. I
      have seen and slept in many like it since. Scattered wide, they littered
      the frontier from the Columbia to the Rio Grande, from the Missouri to the
      Sierras. They lay stark, dotted over a planet of treeless dust, like
      soiled packs of cards. Each was similar to the next, as one old five-spot
      of clubs resembles another. Houses, empty bottles, and garbage, they were
      forever of the same shapeless pattern. More forlorn they were than stale
      bones. They seemed to have been strewn there by the wind and to be waiting
      till the wind should come again and blow them away. Yet serene above their
      foulness swam a pure and quiet light, such as the East never sees; they
      might be bathing in the air of creation's first morning. Beneath sun and
      stars their days and nights were immaculate and wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medicine Bow was my first, and I took its dimensions, twenty-nine
      buildings in all,&mdash;one coal shute, one water tank, the station, one
      store, two eating-houses, one billiard hall, two tool-houses, one feed
      stable, and twelve others that for one reason and another I shall not
      name. Yet this wretched husk of squalor spent thought upon appearances;
      many houses in it wore a false front to seem as if they were two stories
      high. There they stood, rearing their pitiful masquerade amid a fringe of
      old tin cans, while at their very doors began a world of crystal light, a
      land without end, a space across which Noah and Adam might come straight
      from Genesis. Into that space went wandering a road, over a hill and down
      out of sight, and up again smaller in the distance, and down once more,
      and up once more, straining the eyes, and so away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I heard a fellow greet my Virginian. He came rollicking out of a
      door, and made a pass with his hand at the Virginian's hat. The Southerner
      dodged it, and I saw once more the tiger undulation of body, and knew my
      escort was he of the rope and the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are yu' Steve?&rdquo; he said to the rollicking man. And in his tone I
      heard instantly old friendship speaking. With Steve he would take and give
      familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steve looked at me, and looked away&mdash;and that was all. But it was
      enough. In no company had I ever felt so much an outsider. Yet I liked the
      company, and wished that it would like me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just come to town?&rdquo; inquired Steve of the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been here since noon. Been waiting for the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going out to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I'll pull out to-morro'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beds are all took,&rdquo; said Steve. This was for my benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I guess one of them drummers will let yu' double up with him.&rdquo; Steve
      was enjoying himself, I think. He had his saddle and blankets, and beds
      were nothing to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drummers, are they?&rdquo; asked the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two Jews handling cigars, one American with consumption killer, and a
      Dutchman with jew'lry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian set down my valise, and seemed to meditate. &ldquo;I did want a
      bed to-night,&rdquo; he murmured gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Steve suggested, &ldquo;the American looks like he washed the oftenest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's of no consequence to me,&rdquo; observed the Southerner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess it'll be when yu' see 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm meaning something different. I wanted a bed to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll have to build one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet yu' I have the Dutchman's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a man that won't scare. Bet yu' drinks yu' can't have the
      American's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go yu'&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;I'll have his bed without any fuss. Drinks
      for the crowd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you have me beat,&rdquo; said Steve, grinning at him affectionately.
      &ldquo;You're such a son-of-a&mdash;&mdash; when you get down to work. Well, so
      long! I got to fix my horse's hoofs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had expected that the man would be struck down. He had used to the
      Virginian a term of heaviest insult, I thought. I had marvelled to hear it
      come so unheralded from Steve's friendly lips. And now I marvelled still
      more. Evidently he had meant no harm by it, and evidently no offence had
      been taken. Used thus, this language was plainly complimentary. I had
      stepped into a world new to me indeed, and novelties were occurring with
      scarce any time to get breath between them. As to where I should sleep, I
      had forgotten that problem altogether in my curiosity. What was the
      Virginian going to do now? I began to know that the quiet of this man was
      volcanic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you wash first, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were at the door of the eating-house, and he set my valise inside. In
      my tenderfoot innocence I was looking indoors for the washing
      arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's out hyeh, seh,&rdquo; he informed me gravely, but with strong Southern
      accent. Internal mirth seemed often to heighten the local flavor of his
      speech. There were other times when it had scarce any special accent or
      fault in grammar.
    </p>
    <p>
      A trough was to my right, slippery with soapy water; and hanging from a
      roller above one end of it was a rag of discouraging appearance. The
      Virginian caught it, and it performed one whirling revolution on its
      roller. Not a dry or clean inch could be found on it. He took off his hat,
      and put his head in the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your towel, ma'am,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has been too popular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came out, a pretty woman. Her eyes rested upon him for a moment, then
      upon me with disfavor; then they returned to his black hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The allowance is one a day,&rdquo; said she, very quietly. &ldquo;But when folks are
      particular&mdash;&rdquo; She completed her sentence by removing the old towel
      and giving a clean one to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, ma'am,&rdquo; said the cow-puncher.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked once more at his black hair, and without any word returned to
      her guests at supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pail stood in the trough, almost empty; and this he filled for me from a
      well. There was some soap sliding at large in the trough, but I got my
      own. And then in a tin basin I removed as many of the stains of travel as
      I was able. It was not much of a toilet that I made in this first
      wash-trough of my experience, but it had to suffice, and I took my seat at
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Canned stuff it was,&mdash;corned beef. And one of my table companions
      said the truth about it. &ldquo;When I slung my teeth over that,&rdquo; he remarked,
      &ldquo;I thought I was chewing a hammock.&rdquo; We had strange coffee, and condensed
      milk; and I have never seen more flies. I made no attempt to talk, for no
      one in this country seemed favorable to me. By reason of something,&mdash;my
      clothes, my hat, my pronunciation, whatever it might be, I possessed the
      secret of estranging people at sight. Yet I was doing better than I knew;
      my strict silence and attention to the corned beef made me in the eyes of
      the cow-boys at table compare well with the over-talkative commercial
      travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian's entrance produced a slight silence. He had done wonders
      with the wash-trough, and he had somehow brushed his clothes. With all the
      roughness of his dress, he was now the neatest of us. He nodded to some of
      the other cow-boys, and began his meal in quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But silence is not the native element of the drummer. An average fish can
      go a longer time out of water than this breed can live without talking.
      One of them now looked across the table at the grave, flannel-shirted
      Virginian; he inspected, and came to the imprudent conclusion that he
      understood his man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; he said briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just come to town?&rdquo; pursued the drummer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just come to town,&rdquo; the Virginian suavely assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cattle business jumping along?&rdquo; inquired the drummer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fair.&rdquo; And the Virginian took some more corned beef.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gets a move on your appetite, anyway,&rdquo; suggested the drummer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian drank some coffee. Presently the pretty woman refilled his
      cup without his asking her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess I've met you before,&rdquo; the drummer stated next.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian glanced at him for a brief moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't I, now? Ain't I seen you somewhere? Look at me. You been in
      Chicago, ain't you? You look at me well. Remember Ikey's, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't reckon I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, now! I knowed you'd been in Chicago. Four or five years ago. Or
      maybe it's two years. Time's nothing to me. But I never forget a face.
      Yes, sir. Him and me's met at Ikey's, all right.&rdquo; This important point the
      drummer stated to all of us. We were called to witness how well he had
      proved old acquaintanceship. &ldquo;Ain't the world small, though!&rdquo; he exclaimed
      complacently. &ldquo;Meet a man once and you're sure to run on to him again.
      That's straight. That's no bar-room josh.&rdquo; And the drummer's eye included
      us all in his confidence. I wondered if he had attained that high
      perfection when a man believes his own lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian did not seem interested. He placidly attended to his food,
      while our landlady moved between dining room and kitchen, and the drummer
      expanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir! Ikey's over by the stock-yards, patronized by all cattle-men
      that know what's what. That's where. Maybe it's three years. Time never
      was nothing to me. But faces! Why, I can't quit 'em. Adults or children,
      male and female; onced I seen 'em I couldn't lose one off my memory, not
      if you were to pay me bounty, five dollars a face. White men, that is.
      Can't do nothing with niggers or Chinese. But you're white, all right.&rdquo;
       The drummer suddenly returned to the Virginian with this high compliment.
      The cow-puncher had taken out a pipe, and was slowly rubbing it. The
      compliment seemed to escape his attention, and the drummer went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell a man when he's white, put him at Ikey's or out loose here in
      the sage-brush.&rdquo; And he rolled a cigar across to the Virginian's plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selling them?&rdquo; inquired the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solid goods, my friend. Havana wrappers, the biggest tobacco proposition
      for five cents got out yet. Take it, try it, light it, watch it burn.
      Here.&rdquo; And he held out a bunch of matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian tossed a five-cent piece over to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, my friend! Not from you! Not after Ikey's. I don't forget you.
      See? I knowed your face right away. See? That's straight. I seen you at
      Chicago all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you did,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;Sometimes I'm mighty careless what I
      look at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, py damn!&rdquo; now exclaimed the Dutch drummer, hilariously. &ldquo;I am ploom
      disappointed. I vas hoping to sell him somedings myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the same here,&rdquo; stated the American. &ldquo;He's too healthy for me. I gave
      him up on sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now it was the American drummer whose bed the Virginian had in his eye.
      This was a sensible man, and had talked less than his brothers in the
      trade. I had little doubt who would end by sleeping in his bed; but how
      the thing would be done interested me more deeply than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian looked amiably at his intended victim, and made one or two
      remarks regarding patent medicines. There must be a good deal of money in
      them, he supposed, with a live man to manage them. The victim was
      flattered. No other person at the table had been favored with so much of
      the tall cow-puncher's notice. He responded, and they had a pleasant talk.
      I did not divine that the Virginian's genius was even then at work, and
      that all this was part of his satanic strategy. But Steve must have
      divined it. For while a few of us still sat finishing our supper, that
      facetious horseman returned from doctoring his horse's hoofs, put his head
      into the dining room, took in the way in which the Virginian was engaging
      his victim in conversation, remarked aloud, &ldquo;I've lost!&rdquo; and closed the
      door again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's he lost?&rdquo; inquired the American drummer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mustn't mind him,&rdquo; drawled the Virginian. &ldquo;He's one of those
      box-head jokers goes around openin' and shuttin' doors that-a-way. We call
      him harmless. Well,&rdquo; he broke off, &ldquo;I reckon I'll go smoke. Not allowed in
      hyeh?&rdquo; This last he addressed to the landlady, with especial gentleness.
      She shook her head, and her eyes followed him as he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to myself I meditated for some time upon my lodging for the night,
      and smoked a cigar for consolation as I walked about. It was not a hotel
      that we had supped in. Hotel at Medicine Bow there appeared to be none.
      But connected with the eating-house was that place where, according to
      Steve, the beds were all taken, and there I went to see for myself. Steve
      had spoken the truth. It was a single apartment containing four or five
      beds, and nothing else whatever. And when I looked at these beds, my
      sorrow that I could sleep in none of them grew less. To be alone in one
      offered no temptation, and as for this courtesy of the country, this
      doubling up&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they have got ahead of us.&rdquo; This was the Virginian standing at my
      elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have staked out their claims,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this public sleeping room they had done what one does to secure a seat
      in a railroad train. Upon each bed, as notice of occupancy, lay some
      article of travel or of dress. As we stood there, the two Jews came in and
      opened and arranged their valises, and folded and refolded their linen
      dusters. Then a railroad employee entered and began to go to bed at this
      hour, before dusk had wholly darkened into night. For him, going to bed
      meant removing his boots and placing his overalls and waistcoat beneath
      his pillow. He had no coat. His work began at three in the morning; and
      even as we still talked he began to snore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man that keeps the store is a friend of mine,&rdquo; said the Virginian;
      &ldquo;and you can be pretty near comfortable on his counter. Got any blankets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had no blankets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking for a bed?&rdquo; inquired the American drummer, now arriving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he's looking for a bed,&rdquo; answered the voice of Steve behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems a waste of time,&rdquo; observed the Virginian. He looked thoughtfully
      from one bed to another. &ldquo;I didn't know I'd have to lay over here. Well, I
      have sat up before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one's mine,&rdquo; said the drummer, sitting down on it. &ldquo;Half's plenty
      enough room for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're cert'nly mighty kind,&rdquo; said the cow-puncher. &ldquo;But I'd not think o'
      disconveniencing yu'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nothing. The other half is yours. Turn in right now if you feel
      like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I don't reckon I'll turn in right now. Better keep your bed to
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; urged the drummer, &ldquo;if I take you I'm safe from drawing some
      party I might not care so much about. This here sleeping proposition is a
      lottery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Virginian (and his hesitation was truly masterly), &ldquo;if
      you put it that way&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do put it that way. Why, you're clean! You've had a shave right now.
      You turn in when you feel inclined, old man! I ain't retiring just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The drummer had struck a slightly false note in these last remarks. He
      should not have said &ldquo;old man.&rdquo; Until this I had thought him merely an
      amiable person who wished to do a favor. But &ldquo;old man&rdquo; came in wrong. It
      had a hateful taint of his profession; the being too soon with everybody,
      the celluloid good-fellowship that passes for ivory with nine in ten of
      the city crowd. But not so with the sons of the sagebrush. They live
      nearer nature, and they know better.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Virginian blandly accepted &ldquo;old man&rdquo; from his victim: he had a
      game to play. &ldquo;Well, I cert'nly thank yu',&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After a while I'll
      take advantage of your kind offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised. Possession being nine points of the law, it seemed his
      very chance to intrench himself in the bed. But the cow-puncher had
      planned a campaign needing no intrenchments. Moreover, going to bed before
      nine o'clock upon the first evening in many weeks that a town's resources
      were open to you, would be a dull proceeding. Our entire company, drummer
      and all, now walked over to the store, and here my sleeping arrangements
      were made easily. This store was the cleanest place and the best in
      Medicine Bow, and would have been a good store anywhere, offering a
      multitude of things for sale, and kept by a very civil proprietor. He bade
      me make myself at home, and placed both of his counters at my disposal.
      Upon the grocery side there stood a cheese too large and strong to sleep
      near comfortably, and I therefore chose the dry-goods side. Here thick
      quilts were unrolled for me, to make it soft; and no condition was placed
      upon me, further than that I should remove my boots, because the quilts
      were new, and clean, and for sale. So now my rest was assured. Not an
      anxiety remained in my thoughts. These therefore turned themselves wholly
      to the other man's bed, and how he was going to lose it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that Steve was more curious even than myself. Time was on the
      wing. His bet must be decided, and the drinks enjoyed. He stood against
      the grocery counter, contemplating the Virginian. But it was to me that he
      spoke. The Virginian, however, listened to every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your first visit to this country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I expected to like it very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does the climate strike you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought the climate was fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Makes a man thirsty though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the sub-current which the Virginian plainly looked for. But he,
      like Steve, addressed himself to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he put in, &ldquo;thirsty while a man's soft yet. You'll harden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you'll find it a drier country than you were given to expect,&rdquo;
       said Steve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your habits have been frequent that way,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's parts of Wyoming,&rdquo; pursued Steve, &ldquo;where you'll go hours and
      hours before you'll see a drop of wetness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if yu' keep a-thinkin' about it,&rdquo; said the Virginian, &ldquo;it'll seem
      like days and days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steve, at this stroke, gave up, and clapped him on the shoulder with a
      joyous chuckle. &ldquo;You old son-of-a!&rdquo; he cried affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drinks are due now,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;My treat, Steve. But I reckon
      your suspense will have to linger a while yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus they dropped into direct talk from that speech of the fourth
      dimension where they had been using me for their telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any cyards going to-night?&rdquo; inquired the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stud and draw,&rdquo; Steve told him. &ldquo;Strangers playing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I'd like to get into a game for a while,&rdquo; said the Southerner.
      &ldquo;Strangers, yu' say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, before quitting the store, he made his toilet for this little
      hand at poker. It was a simple preparation. He took his pistol from its
      holster, examined it, then shoved it between his overalls and his shirt in
      front, and pulled his waistcoat over it. He might have been combing his
      hair for all the attention any one paid to this, except myself. Then the
      two friends went out, and I bethought me of that epithet which Steve again
      had used to the Virginian as he clapped him on the shoulder. Clearly this
      wild country spoke a language other than mine&mdash;the word here was a
      term of endearment. Such was my conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drummers had finished their dealings with the proprietor, and they
      were gossiping together in a knot by the door as the Virginian passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See you later, old man!&rdquo; This was the American drummer accosting his
      prospective bed-fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; returned the bed-fellow, and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The American drummer winked triumphantly at his brethren. &ldquo;He's all
      right,&rdquo; he observed, jerking a thumb after the Virginian. &ldquo;He's easy. You
      got to know him to work him. That's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Und vat is your point?&rdquo; inquired the German drummer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Point is&mdash;he'll not take any goods off you or me; but he's going to
      talk up the killer to any consumptive he runs across. I ain't done with
      him yet. Say,&rdquo; (he now addressed the proprietor), &ldquo;what's her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman runs the eating-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glen. Mrs. Glen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't she new?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been settled here about a month. Husband's a freight conductor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought I'd not seen her before. She's a good-looker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm! Yes. The kind of good looks I'd sooner see in another man's wife than
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that's the gait, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm! well, it don't seem to be. She come here with that reputation. But
      there's been general disappointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she ain't lacked suitors any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lacked! Are you acquainted with cow-boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she disappointed 'em? Maybe she likes her husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm! well, how are you to tell about them silent kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking of conductors,&rdquo; began the drummer. And we listened to his
      anecdote. It was successful with his audience; but when he launched
      fluently upon a second I strolled out. There was not enough wit in this
      narrator to relieve his indecency, and I felt shame at having been
      surprised into laughing with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left that company growing confidential over their leering stories, and I
      sought the saloon. It was very quiet and orderly. Beer in quart bottles at
      a dollar I had never met before; but saving its price, I found no
      complaint to make of it. Through folding doors I passed from the bar
      proper with its bottles and elk head back to the hall with its various
      tables. I saw a man sliding cards from a case, and across the table from
      him another man laying counters down. Near by was a second dealer pulling
      cards from the bottom of a pack, and opposite him a solemn old rustic
      piling and changing coins upon the cards which lay already exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now I heard a voice that drew my eyes to the far corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you stay in Arizona?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harmless looking words as I write them down here. Yet at the sound of them
      I noticed the eyes of the others directed to that corner. What answer was
      given to them I did not hear, nor did I see who spoke. Then came another
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Arizona's no place for amatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time the two card dealers that I stood near began to give a part of
      their attention to the group that sat in the corner. There was in me a
      desire to leave this room. So far my hours at Medicine Bow had seemed to
      glide beneath a sunshine of merriment, of easy-going jocularity. This was
      suddenly gone, like the wind changing to north in the middle of a warm
      day. But I stayed, being ashamed to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five or six players sat over in the corner at a round table where counters
      were piled. Their eyes were close upon their cards, and one seemed to be
      dealing a card at a time to each, with pauses and betting between. Steve
      was there and the Virginian; the others were new faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No place for amatures,&rdquo; repeated the voice; and now I saw that it was the
      dealer's. There was in his countenance the same ugliness that his words
      conveyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's that talkin'?&rdquo; said one of the men near me, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trampas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cow-puncher, bronco-buster, tin-horn, most anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's he talkin' at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think it's the black-headed guy he's talking at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ain't supposed to be safe, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess we're all goin' to find out in a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been trouble between 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've not met before. Trampas don't enjoy losin' to a stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fello's from Arizona, yu' say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Virginia. He's recently back from havin' a look at Arizona. Went down
      there last year for a change. Works for the Sunk Creek outfit.&rdquo; And then
      the dealer lowered his voice still further and said something in the other
      man's ear, causing him to grin. After which both of them looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been silence over in the corner; but now the man Trampas spoke
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;AND ten,&rdquo; said he, sliding out some chips from before him. Very strange
      it was to hear him, how he contrived to make those words a personal taunt.
      The Virginian was looking at his cards. He might have been deaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;AND twenty,&rdquo; said the next player, easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next threw his cards down.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now the Virginian's turn to bet, or leave the game, and he did not
      speak at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore Trampas spoke. &ldquo;Your bet, you son-of-a&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian's pistol came out, and his hand lay on the table, holding it
      unaimed. And with a voice as gentle as ever, the voice that sounded almost
      like a caress, but drawling a very little more than usual, so that there
      was almost a space between each word, he issued his orders to the man
      Trampas: &ldquo;When you call me that, SMILE.&rdquo; And he looked at Trampas across
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the voice was gentle. But in my ears it seemed as if somewhere the
      bell of death was ringing; and silence, like a stroke, fell on the large
      room. All men present, as if by some magnetic current, had become aware of
      this crisis. In my ignorance, and the total stoppage of my thoughts, I
      stood stock-still, and noticed various people crouching, or shifting their
      positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit quiet,&rdquo; said the dealer, scornfully to the man near me. &ldquo;Can't you
      see he don't want to push trouble? He has handed Trampas the choice to
      back down or draw his steel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with equal suddenness and ease, the room came out of its
      strangeness. Voices and cards, the click of chips, the puff of tobacco,
      glasses lifted to drink,&mdash;this level of smooth relaxation hinted no
      more plainly of what lay beneath than does the surface tell the depth of
      the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Trampas had made his choice. And that choice was not to &ldquo;draw his
      steel.&rdquo; If it was knowledge that he sought, he had found it, and no
      mistake! We heard no further reference to what he had been pleased to
      style &ldquo;amatures.&rdquo; In no company would the black-headed man who had visited
      Arizona be rated a novice at the cool art of self-preservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      One doubt remained: what kind of a man was Trampas? A public back-down is
      an unfinished thing,&mdash;for some natures at least. I looked at his
      face, and thought it sullen, but tricky rather than courageous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something had been added to my knowledge also. Once again I had heard
      applied to the Virginian that epithet which Steve so freely used. The same
      words, identical to the letter. But this time they had produced a pistol.
      &ldquo;When you call me that, SMILE!&rdquo; So I perceived a new example of the old
      truth, that the letter means nothing until the spirit gives it life.

      III. STEVE TREATS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was for several minutes, I suppose, that I stood drawing these silent
      morals. No man occupied himself with me. Quiet voices, and games of
      chance, and glasses lifted to drink, continued to be the peaceful order of
      the night. And into my thoughts broke the voice of that card-dealer who
      had already spoken so sagely. He also took his turn at moralizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; he remarked to the man for whom he continued to
      deal, and who continued to lose money to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't I tell you he'd not shoot?&rdquo; the dealer pursued with complacence.
      &ldquo;You got ready to dodge. You had no call to be concerned. He's not the
      kind a man need feel anxious about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The player looked over at the Virginian, doubtfully. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
      don't know what you folks call a dangerous man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not him!&rdquo; exclaimed the dealer with admiration. &ldquo;He's a brave man. That's
      different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The player seemed to follow this reasoning no better than I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not a brave man that's dangerous,&rdquo; continued the dealer. &ldquo;It's the
      cowards that scare me.&rdquo; He paused that this might sink home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fello' came in here las' Toosday,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;He got into some
      misunderstanding about the drinks. Well, sir, before we could put him out
      of business, he'd hurt two perfectly innocent onlookers. They'd no more to
      do with it than you have,&rdquo; the dealer explained to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were they badly hurt?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of 'em was. He's died since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we put him out of business, I told you. He died that night. But
      there was no occasion for any of it; and that's why I never like to be
      around where there's a coward. You can't tell. He'll always go to shooting
      before it's necessary, and there's no security who he'll hit. But a man
      like that black-headed guy is (the dealer indicated the Virginian) need
      never worry you. And there's another point why there's no need to worry
      about him: IT'D BE TOO LATE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These good words ended the moralizing of the dealer. He had given us a
      piece of his mind. He now gave the whole of it to dealing cards. I
      loitered here and there, neither welcome nor unwelcome at present,
      watching the cow-boys at their play. Saving Trampas, there was scarce a
      face among them that had not in it something very likable. Here were lusty
      horsemen ridden from the heat of the sun, and the wet of the storm, to
      divert themselves awhile. Youth untamed sat here for an idle moment,
      spending easily its hard-earned wages. City saloons rose into my vision,
      and I instantly preferred this Rocky Mountain place. More of death it
      undoubtedly saw, but less of vice, than did its New York equivalents.
    </p>
    <p>
      And death is a thing much cleaner than vice. Moreover, it was by no means
      vice that was written upon these wild and manly faces. Even where baseness
      was visible, baseness was not uppermost. Daring, laughter, endurance&mdash;these
      were what I saw upon the countenances of the cow-boys. And this very first
      day of my knowledge of them marks a date with me. For something about
      them, and the idea of them, smote my American heart, and I have never
      forgotten it, nor ever shall, as long as I live. In their flesh our
      natural passions ran tumultuous; but often in their spirit sat hidden a
      true nobility, and often beneath its unexpected shining their figures took
      on heroic stature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dealer had styled the Virginian &ldquo;a black-headed guy.&rdquo; This did well
      enough as an unflattered portrait. Judge Henry's trustworthy man, with
      whom I was to drive two hundred and sixty-three miles, certainly had a
      very black head of hair. It was the first thing to notice now, if one
      glanced generally at the table where he sat at cards. But the eye came
      back to him&mdash;drawn by that inexpressible something which had led the
      dealer to speak so much at length about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, &ldquo;black-headed guy&rdquo; justly fits him and his next performance. He had
      made his plan for this like a true and (I must say) inspired devil. And
      now the highly appreciative town of Medicine Bow was to be treated to a
      manifestation of genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat playing his stud-poker. After a decent period of losing and
      winning, which gave Trampas all proper time for a change of luck and a
      repairing of his fortunes, he looked at Steve and said amiably: &ldquo;How does
      bed strike you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was beside their table, learning gradually that stud-poker has in it
      more of what I will call red pepper than has our Eastern game. The
      Virginian followed his own question: &ldquo;Bed strikes me,&rdquo; he stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steve feigned indifference. He was far more deeply absorbed in his bet and
      the American drummer than he was in this game; but he chose to take out a
      fat, florid gold watch, consult it elaborately, and remark, &ldquo;It's only
      eleven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yu' forget I'm from the country,&rdquo; said the black-headed guy. &ldquo;The
      chickens have been roostin' a right smart while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sunny Southern accent was again strong. In that brief passage with
      Trampas it had been almost wholly absent. But different moods of the
      spirit bring different qualities of utterance&mdash;where a man comes by
      these naturally. The Virginian cashed in his checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awhile ago,&rdquo; said Steve, &ldquo;you had won three months' salary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm still twenty dollars to the good,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;That's better
      than breaking a laig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again, in some voiceless, masonic way, most people in that saloon had
      become aware that something was in process of happening. Several left
      their games and came to the front by the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he ain't in bed yet&mdash;&rdquo; mused the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll find out,&rdquo; said I. And I hurried across to the dim sleeping room,
      happy to have a part in this.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all in bed; and in some beds two were sleeping. How they could
      do it&mdash;but in those days I was fastidious. The American had come in
      recently and was still awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought you were to sleep at the store?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then I invented a little lie, and explained that I was in search of the
      Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better search the dives,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;These cow-boys don't get to town
      often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point I stumbled sharply over something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my box of Consumption Killer,&rdquo; explained the drummer; &ldquo;Well, I hope
      that man will stay out all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bed narrow?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For two it is. And the pillows are mean. Takes both before you feel
      anything's under your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He yawned, and I wished him pleasant dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      At my news the Virginian left the bar at once; and crossed to the sleeping
      room. Steve and I followed softly, and behind us several more strung out
      in an expectant line. &ldquo;What is this going to be?&rdquo; they inquired curiously
      of each other. And upon learning the great novelty of the event, they
      clustered with silence intense outside the door where the Virginian had
      gone in.
    </p>
    <p>
      We heard the voice of the drummer, cautioning his bed-fellow. &ldquo;Don't trip
      over the Killer,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;The Prince of Wales barked his shin just
      now.&rdquo; It seemed my English clothes had earned me this title.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boots of the Virginian were next heard to drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can yu' make out what he's at?&rdquo; whispered Steve.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was plainly undressing. The rip of swift unbuttoning told us that the
      black-headed guy must now be removing his overalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thank yu', no,&rdquo; he was replying to a question of the drummer.
      &ldquo;Outside or in's all one to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if you'd just as soon take the wall&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, cert'nly.&rdquo; There was a sound of bedclothes, and creaking. &ldquo;This hyeh
      pillo' needs a Southern climate,&rdquo; was the Virginian's next observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many listeners had now gathered at the door. The dealer and the player
      were both here. The storekeeper was present, and I recognized the agent of
      the Union Pacific Railroad among the crowd. We made a large company, and I
      felt that trembling sensation which is common when the cap of a camera is
      about to be removed upon a group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; said the drummer's voice, &ldquo;that you'd feel your knife
      and gun clean through that pillow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; responded the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you'd put them on a chair and be comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd be uncomfortable, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Used to the feel of them, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it. Used to the feel of them. I would miss them, and that would
      make me wakeful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night. If I get to talkin' and tossin', or what not, you'll
      understand you're to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'll wake you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don't yu', for God's sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't yu' touch me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roll away quick to your side. It don't last but a minute.&rdquo; The Virginian
      spoke with a reassuring drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this there fell a brief silence, and I heard the drummer clear his
      throat once or twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's merely the nightmare, I suppose?&rdquo; he said after a throat clearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, yes. That's all. And don't happen twice a year. Was you thinkin' it
      was fits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I just wanted to know. I've been told before that it was not safe
      for a person to be waked suddenly that way out of a nightmare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have heard that too. But it never harms me any. I didn't want you
      to run risks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it'll be all right now that yu' know how it is.&rdquo; The Virginian's
      drawl was full of assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a second pause, after which the drummer said:--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me again how it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian answered very drowsily: &ldquo;Oh, just don't let your arm or your
      laig touch me if I go to jumpin' around. I'm dreamin' of Indians when I do
      that. And if anything touches me then, I'm liable to grab my knife right
      in my sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I understand,&rdquo; said the drummer, clearing his throat. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steve was whispering delighted oaths to himself, and in his joy applying
      to the Virginian one unprintable name after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      We listened again, but now no further words came. Listening very hard, I
      could half make out the progress of a heavy breathing, and a restless
      turning I could clearly detect. This was the wretched drummer. He was
      waiting. But he did not wait long. Again there was a light creak, and
      after it a light step. He was not even going to put his boots on in the
      fatal neighborhood of the dreamer. By a happy thought Medicine Bow formed
      into two lines, making an avenue from the door. And then the commercial
      traveller forgot his Consumption Killer. He fell heavily over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately from the bed the Virginian gave forth a dreadful howl.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then everything happened at once; and how shall mere words narrate it?
      The door burst open, and out flew the commercial traveller in his
      stockings. One hand held a lump of coat and trousers with suspenders
      dangling, his boots were clutched in the other. The sight of us stopped
      his flight short. He gazed, the boots fell from his hand; and at his
      profane explosion, Medicine Bow set up a united, unearthly noise and began
      to play Virginia reel with him. The other occupants of the beds had
      already sprung out of them, clothed chiefly with their pistols, and ready
      for war. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; they demanded. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I reckon it's drinks on Steve,&rdquo; said the Virginian from his bed. And
      he gave the first broad grin that I had seen from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll set 'em up all night!&rdquo; Steve shouted, as the reel went on
      regardless. The drummer was bawling to be allowed to put at least his
      boots on. &ldquo;This way, Pard,&rdquo; was the answer; and another man whirled him
      round. &ldquo;This way, Beau!&rdquo; they called to him; &ldquo;This way, Budd!&rdquo; and he was
      passed like a shuttle-cock down the line. Suddenly the leaders bounded
      into the sleeping-room. &ldquo;Feed the machine!&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Feed her!&rdquo; And
      seizing the German drummer who sold jewellery, they flung him into the
      trough of the reel. I saw him go bouncing like an ear of corn to be
      shelled, and the dance ingulfed him. I saw a Jew sent rattling after him;
      and next they threw in the railroad employee, and the other Jew; and while
      I stood mesmerized, my own feet left the earth. I shot from the room and
      sped like a bobbing cork into this mill race, whirling my turn in the wake
      of the others amid cries of, &ldquo;Here comes the Prince of Wales!&rdquo; There was
      soon not much English left about my raiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now shouting for music. Medicine Bow swept in like a cloud of
      dust to where a fiddler sat playing in a hall; and gathering up fiddler
      and dancers, swept out again, a larger Medicine Bow, growing all the
      while. Steve offered us the freedom of the house, everywhere. He implored
      us to call for whatever pleased us, and as many times as we should please.
      He ordered the town to be searched for more citizens to come and help him
      pay his bet. But changing his mind, kegs and bottles were now carried
      along with us. We had found three fiddlers, and these played busily for
      us; and thus we set out to visit all cabins and houses where people might
      still by some miracle be asleep. The first man put out his head to
      decline. But such a possibility had been foreseen by the proprietor of the
      store. This seemingly respectable man now came dragging some sort of
      apparatus from his place, helped by the Virginian. The cow-boys cheered,
      for they knew what this was. The man in his window likewise recognized it,
      and uttering a groan, came immediately out and joined us. What it was, I
      also learned in a few minutes. For we found a house where the people made
      no sign at either our fiddlers or our knocking. And then the infernal
      machine was set to work. Its parts seemed to be no more than an empty keg
      and a plank. Some citizen informed me that I should soon have a new idea
      of noise; and I nerved myself for something severe in the way of
      gunpowder. But the Virginian and the proprietor now sat on the ground
      holding the keg braced, and two others got down apparently to play see-saw
      over the top of it with the plank. But the keg and plank had been rubbed
      with rosin, and they drew the plank back and forth over the keg. Do you
      know the sound made in a narrow street by a dray loaded with strips of
      iron? That noise is a lullaby compared with the staggering, blinding
      bellow which rose from the keg. If you were to try it in your native town,
      you would not merely be arrested, you would be hanged, and everybody would
      be glad, and the clergyman would not bury you. My head, my teeth, the
      whole system of my bones leaped and chattered at the din, and out of the
      house like drops squirted from a lemon came a man and his wife. No time
      was given them. They were swept along with the rest; and having been
      routed from their own bed, they now became most furious in assailing the
      remaining homes of Medicine Bow. Everybody was to come out. Many were now
      riding horses at top speed out into the plains and back, while the
      procession of the plank and keg continued its work, and the fiddlers
      played incessantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a quiet. I did not see who brought the message; but the
      word ran among us that there was a woman&mdash;the engineer's woman down
      by the water-tank&mdash;very sick. The doctor had been to see her from
      Laramie. Everybody liked the engineer. Plank and keg were heard no more.
      The horsemen found it out and restrained their gambols. Medicine Bow went
      gradually home. I saw doors shutting, and lights go out; I saw a late few
      reassemble at the card tables, and the drummers gathered themselves
      together for sleep; the proprietor of the store (you could not see a more
      respectable-looking person) hoped that I would be comfortable on the
      quilts; and I heard Steve urging the Virginian to take one more glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've not met for so long,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Virginian, the black-headed guy who had set all this nonsense
      going, said No to Steve. &ldquo;I have got to stay responsible,&rdquo; was his excuse
      to his friend. And the friend looked at me. Therefore I surmised that the
      Judge's trustworthy man found me an embarrassment to his holiday. But if
      he did, he never showed it to me. He had been sent to meet a stranger and
      drive him to Sunk Creek in safety, and this charge he would allow no
      temptation to imperil. He nodded good night to me. &ldquo;If there's anything I
      can do for yu', you'll tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him. &ldquo;What a pleasant evening!&rdquo; I added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad yu' found it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again his manner put a bar to my approaches. Even though I had seen him
      wildly disporting himself, those were matters which he chose not to
      discuss with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medicine Bow was quiet as I went my way to my quilts. So still, that
      through the air the deep whistles of the freight trains came from below
      the horizon across great miles of silence. I passed cow-boys, whom half an
      hour before I had seen prancing and roaring, now rolled in their blankets
      beneath the open and shining night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What world am I in?&rdquo; I said aloud. &ldquo;Does this same planet hold Fifth
      Avenue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I went to sleep, pondering over my native land.

    <h2>
      IV. DEEP INTO CATTLE LAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Morning had been for some while astir in Medicine Bow before I left my
      quilts. The new day and its doings began around me in the store, chiefly
      at the grocery counter. Dry-goods were not in great request. The early
      rising cow-boys were off again to their work; and those to whom their
      night's holiday had left any dollars were spending these for tobacco, or
      cartridges, or canned provisions for the journey to their distant camps.
      Sardines were called for, and potted chicken, and devilled ham: a
      sophisticated nourishment, at first sight, for these sons of the
      sage-brush. But portable ready-made food plays of necessity a great part
      in the opening of a new country. These picnic pots and cans were the first
      of her trophies that Civilization dropped upon Wyoming's virgin soil. The
      cow-boy is now gone to worlds invisible; the wind has blown away the white
      ashes of his camp-fires; but the empty sardine box lies rusting over the
      face of the Western earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      So through my eyes half closed I watched the sale of these tins, and grew
      familiar with the ham's inevitable trademark&mdash;that label with the
      devil and his horns and hoofs and tail very pronounced, all colored a
      sultry prodigious scarlet. And when each horseman had made his purchase,
      he would trail his spurs over the floor, and presently the sound of his
      horse's hoofs would be the last of him. Through my dozing attention came
      various fragments of talk, and sometimes useful bits of knowledge. For
      instance, I learned the true value of tomatoes in this country. One fellow
      was buying two cans of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meadow Creek dry already?&rdquo; commented the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been dry ten days,&rdquo; the young cow-boy informed him. And it appeared that
      along the road he was going, water would not be reached much before
      sundown, because this Meadow Creek had ceased to run. His tomatoes were
      for drink. And thus they have refreshed me many times since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No beer?&rdquo; suggested the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy made a shuddering face. &ldquo;Don't say its name to me!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
      &ldquo;I couldn't hold my breakfast down.&rdquo; He rang his silver money upon the
      counter. &ldquo;I've swore off for three months,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;I'm going to be as
      pure as the snow!&rdquo; And away he went jingling out of the door, to ride
      seventy-five miles. Three more months of hard, unsheltered work, and he
      would ride into town again, with his adolescent blood crying aloud for its
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm obliged,&rdquo; said a new voice, rousing me from a new doze. &ldquo;She's easier
      this morning, since the medicine.&rdquo; This was the engineer, whose sick wife
      had brought a hush over Medicine Bow's rioting. &ldquo;I'll give her them
      flowers soon as she wakes,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flowers?&rdquo; repeated the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't leave that bunch at our door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish I'd thought to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She likes to see flowers,&rdquo; said the engineer. And he walked out slowly,
      with his thanks unachieved. He returned at once with the Virginian; for in
      the band of the Virginian's hat were two or three blossoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't need mentioning,&rdquo; the Southerner was saying, embarrassed by any
      expression of thanks. &ldquo;If we had knowed last night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't disturb her any,&rdquo; broke in the engineer. &ldquo;She's easier this
      morning. I'll tell her about them flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it don't need mentioning,&rdquo; the Virginian again protested, almost
      crossly. &ldquo;The little things looked kind o' fresh, and I just picked them.&rdquo;
       His eye now fell upon me, where I lay upon the counter. &ldquo;I reckon
      breakfast will be getting through,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was soon at the wash trough. It was only half-past six, but many had
      been before me,&mdash;one glance at the roller-towel told me that. I was
      afraid to ask the landlady for a clean one, and so I found a fresh
      handkerchief, and accomplished a sparing toilet. In the midst of this the
      drummers joined me, one by one, and they used the degraded towel without
      hesitation. In a way they had the best of me; filth was nothing to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest risers in Medicine Bow, we sat at breakfast together; and they
      essayed some light familiarities with the landlady. But these experiments
      were failures. Her eyes did not see, nor did her ears hear them. She
      brought the coffee and the bacon with a sedateness that propriety itself
      could scarce have surpassed. Yet impropriety lurked noiselessly all over
      her. You could not have specified how; it was interblended with her sum
      total. Silence was her apparent habit and her weapon; but the American
      drummer found that she could speak to the point when need came for this.
      During the meal he had praised her golden hair. It was golden indeed, and
      worth a high compliment; but his kind displeased her. She had let it pass,
      however, with no more than a cool stare. But on taking his leave, when he
      came to pay for the meal, he pushed it too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity this must be our last,&rdquo; he said; and as it brought no answer, &ldquo;Ever
      travel?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Where I go, there's room for a pair of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'd better find another jackass,&rdquo; she replied quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was glad that I had not asked for a clean towel.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the commercial travellers I now separated myself, and wandered alone
      in pleasurable aimlessness. It was seven o'clock. Medicine Bow stood
      voiceless and unpeopled. The cow-boys had melted away. The inhabitants
      were indoors, pursuing the business or the idleness of the forenoon.
      Visible motion there was none. No shell upon the dry sands could lie more
      lifeless than Medicine Bow. Looking in at the store, I saw the proprietor
      sitting with his pipe extinct. Looking in at the saloon, I saw the dealer
      dealing dumbly to himself. Up in the sky there was not a cloud nor a bird,
      and on the earth the lightest straw lay becalmed. Once I saw the Virginian
      at an open door, where the golden-haired landlady stood talking with him.
      Sometimes I strolled in the town, and sometimes out on the plain I lay
      down with my day dreams in the sagebrush. Pale herds of antelope were in
      the distance, and near by the demure prairie-dogs sat up and scrutinized
      me. Steve, Trampas, the riot of horsemen, my lost trunk, Uncle Hughey,
      with his abortive brides&mdash;all things merged in my thoughts in a huge,
      delicious indifference. It was like swimming slowly at random in an ocean
      that was smooth, and neither too cool nor too warm. And before I knew it,
      five lazy imperceptible hours had gone thus. There was the Union Pacific
      train, coming as if from shores forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its approach was silent and long drawn out. I easily reached town and the
      platform before it had finished watering at the tank. It moved up, made a
      short halt, I saw my trunk come out of it, and then it moved away silently
      as it had come, smoking and dwindling into distance unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside my trunk was one other, tied extravagantly with white ribbon. The
      fluttering bows caught my attention, and now I suddenly saw a perfectly
      new sight. The Virginian was further down the platform, doubled up with
      laughing. It was good to know that with sufficient cause he could laugh
      like this; a smile had thus far been his limit of external mirth. Rice now
      flew against my hat, and hissing gusts of rice spouted on the platform.
      All the men left in Medicine Bow appeared like magic, and more rice choked
      the atmosphere. Through the general clamor a cracked voice said, &ldquo;Don't
      hit her in the eye, boys!&rdquo; and Uncle Hughey rushed proudly by me with an
      actual wife on his arm. She could easily have been his granddaughter. They
      got at once into a vehicle. The trunk was lifted in behind. And amid
      cheers, rice, shoes, and broad felicitations, the pair drove out of town,
      Uncle Hughey shrieking to the horses and the bride waving unabashed
      adieus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word had come over the wires from Laramie: &ldquo;Uncle Hughey has made it
      this time. Expect him on to-day's number two.&rdquo; And Medicine Bow had
      expected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many words arose on the departure of the new-married couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's he got for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got a gold mine up Bear Creek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And after comment and prophecy, Medicine Bow returned to its dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This meal was my last here for a long while. The Virginian's
      responsibility now returned; duty drove the Judge's trustworthy man to
      take care of me again. He had not once sought my society of his own
      accord; his distaste for what he supposed me to be (I don't exactly know
      what this was) remained unshaken. I have thought that matters of dress and
      speech should not carry with them so much mistrust in our democracy;
      thieves are presumed innocent until proved guilty, but a starched collar
      is condemned at once. Perfect civility and obligingness I certainly did
      receive from the Virginian, only not a word of fellowship. He harnessed
      the horses, got my trunk, and gave me some advice about taking provisions
      for our journey, something more palatable than what food we should find
      along the road. It was well thought of, and I bought quite a parcel of
      dainties, feeling that he would despise both them and me. And thus I took
      my seat beside him, wondering what we should manage to talk about for two
      hundred and sixty-three miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farewell in those days was not said in Cattle Land. Acquaintances watched
      our departure with a nod or with nothing, and the nearest approach to
      &ldquo;Good-by&rdquo; was the proprietor's &ldquo;So-long.&rdquo; But I caught sight of one
      farewell given without words.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we drove by the eating-house, the shade of a side window was raised,
      and the landlady looked her last upon the Virginian. Her lips were faintly
      parted, and no woman's eyes ever said more plainly, &ldquo;I am one of your
      possessions.&rdquo; She had forgotten that it might be seen. Her glance caught
      mine, and she backed into the dimness of the room. What look she may have
      received from him, if he gave her any at this too public moment, I could
      not tell. His eyes seemed to be upon the horses, and he drove with the
      same mastering ease that had roped the wild pony yesterday. We passed the
      ramparts of Medicine Bow,&mdash;thick heaps and fringes of tin cans, and
      shelving mounds of bottles cast out of the saloons. The sun struck these
      at a hundred glittering points. And in a moment we were in the clean
      plains, with the prairie-dogs and the pale herds of antelope. The great,
      still air bathed us, pure as water and strong as wine; the sunlight
      flooded the world; and shining upon the breast of the Virginian's flannel
      shirt lay a long gold thread of hair! The noisy American drummer had met
      defeat, but this silent free lance had been easily victorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have been five miles that we travelled in silence, losing and
      seeing the horizon among the ceaseless waves of the earth. Then I looked
      back, and there was Medicine Bow, seemingly a stone's throw behind us. It
      was a full half-hour before I looked back again, and there sure enough was
      always Medicine Bow. A size or two smaller, I will admit, but visible in
      every feature, like something seen through the wrong end of a field glass.
      The East-bound express was approaching the town, and I noticed the white
      steam from its whistle; but when the sound reached us, the train had
      almost stopped. And in reply to my comment upon this, the Virginian
      deigned to remark that it was more so in Arizona.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man come to Arizona,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with one of them telescopes to study
      the heavenly bodies. He was a Yankee, seh, and a right smart one, too. And
      one night we was watchin' for some little old fallin' stars that he said
      was due, and I saw some lights movin' along across the mesa pretty lively,
      an' I sang out. But he told me it was just the train. And I told him I
      didn't know yu' could see the cyars that plain from his place, 'Yu' can
      see them,' he said to me, 'but it is las' night's cyars you're lookin'
      at.'&rdquo; At this point the Virginian spoke severely to one of the horses. &ldquo;Of
      course,&rdquo; he then resumed to me, &ldquo;that Yankee man did not mean quite all he
      said.&mdash;You, Buck!&rdquo; he again broke off suddenly to the horse. &ldquo;But
      Arizona, seh,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it cert'nly has a mos' deceivin' atmospheah.
      Another man told me he had seen a lady close one eye at him when he was
      two minutes hard run from her.&rdquo; This time the Virginian gave Buck the
      whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What effect,&rdquo; I inquired with a gravity equal to his own, &ldquo;does this
      extraordinary foreshortening have upon a quart of whiskey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it's outside yu', seh, no distance looks too far to go to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at me with an eye that held more confidence than hitherto he
      had been able to feel in me. I had made one step in his approval. But I
      had many yet to go. This day he preferred his own thoughts to my
      conversation, and so he did all the days of this first journey; while I
      should have greatly preferred his conversation to my thoughts. He
      dismissed some attempts that I made upon the subject of Uncle Hughey so
      that I had not the courage to touch upon Trampas, and that chill brief
      collision which might have struck the spark of death. Trampas! I had
      forgotten him till this silent drive I was beginning. I wondered if I
      should ever see him, or Steve, or any of those people again. And this
      wonder I expressed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no tellin' in this country,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;Folks come
      easy, and they go easy. In settled places, like back in the States, even a
      poor man mostly has a home. Don't care if it's only a barrel on a lot, the
      fello' will keep frequentin' that lot, and if yu' want him yu' can find
      him. But out hyeh in the sage-brush, a man's home is apt to be his saddle
      blanket. First thing yu' know, he has moved it to Texas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done some moving yourself,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this word closed his mouth. &ldquo;I have had a look at the country,&rdquo; he
      said, and we were silent again. Let me, however, tell you here that he had
      set out for a &ldquo;look at the country&rdquo; at the age of fourteen; and that by
      his present age of twenty-four he had seen Arkansas, Texas, New Mexico,
      Arizona, California, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. Everywhere he
      had taken care of himself, and survived; nor had his strong heart yet
      waked up to any hunger for a home. Let me also tell you that he was one of
      thousands drifting and living thus, but (as you shall learn) one in a
      thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medicine Bow did not forever remain in sight. When next I thought of it
      and looked behind, nothing was there but the road we had come; it lay like
      a ship's wake across the huge ground swell of the earth. We were swallowed
      in a vast solitude. A little while before sunset, a cabin came in view;
      and here we passed our first night. Two young men lived here, tending
      their cattle. They were fond of animals. By the stable a chained coyote
      rushed nervously in a circle, or sat on its haunches and snapped at gifts
      of food ungraciously. A tame young elk walked in and out of the cabin
      door, and during supper it tried to push me off my chair. A half-tame
      mountain sheep practised jumping from the ground to the roof. The cabin
      was papered with posters of a circus, and skins of bear and silver fox lay
      upon the floor. Until nine o'clock one man talked to the Virginian, and
      one played gayly upon a concertina; and then we all went to bed. The air
      was like December, but in my blankets and a buffalo robe I kept warm, and
      luxuriated in the Rocky Mountain silence. Going to wash before breakfast
      at sunrise, I found needles of ice in a pail. Yet it was hard to remember
      that this quiet, open, splendid wilderness (with not a peak in sight just
      here) was six thousand feet high. And when breakfast was over there was no
      December left; and by the time the Virginian and I were ten miles upon our
      way, it was June. But always every breath that I breathed was pure as
      water and strong as wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      We never passed a human being this day. Some wild cattle rushed up to us
      and away from us; antelope stared at us from a hundred yards; coyotes ran
      skulking through the sage-brush to watch us from a hill; at our noon meal
      we killed a rattlesnake and shot some young sage chickens, which were good
      at supper, roasted at our camp-fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      By half-past eight we were asleep beneath the stars, and by half-past four
      I was drinking coffee and shivering. The horse, Buck, was hard to catch
      this second morning. Whether some hills that we were now in had excited
      him, or whether the better water up here had caused an effervescence in
      his spirits, I cannot say. But I was as hot as July by the time we had him
      safe in harness, or, rather, unsafe in harness. For Buck, in the
      mysterious language of horses, now taught wickedness to his side partner,
      and about eleven o'clock they laid their evil heads together and decided
      to break our necks.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were passing, I have said, through a range of demi-mountains. It was a
      little country where trees grew, water ran, and the plains were shut out
      for a while. The road had steep places in it, and places here and there
      where you could fall off and go bounding to the bottom among stones. But
      Buck, for some reason, did not think these opportunities good enough for
      him. He selected a more theatrical moment. We emerged from a narrow canyon
      suddenly upon five hundred cattle and some cow-boys branding calves by a
      fire in a corral. It was a sight that Buck knew by heart. He instantly
      treated it like an appalling phenomenon. I saw him kick seven ways; I saw
      Muggins kick five ways; our furious motion snapped my spine like a whip. I
      grasped the seat. Something gave a forlorn jingle. It was the brake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't jump!&rdquo; commanded the trustworthy man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, as my hat flew off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Help was too far away to do anything for us. We passed scatheless through
      a part of the cattle, I saw their horns and backs go by. Some earth
      crumbled, and we plunged downward into water rocking among stones, and
      upward again through some more crumbling earth. I heard a crash, and saw
      my trunk landing in the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's safer there,&rdquo; said the trustworthy man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll go back for her,&rdquo; said he, with his eye on the horses and his foot
      on the crippled brake. A dry gully was coming, and no room to turn. The
      farther side of it was terraced with rock. We should simply fall backward,
      if we did not fall forward first. He steered the horses straight over, and
      just at the bottom swung them, with astonishing skill, to the right along
      the hard-baked mud. They took us along the bed up to the head of the
      gully, and through a thicket of quaking asps. The light trees bent beneath
      our charge and bastinadoed the wagon as it went over them. But their
      branches enmeshed the horses' legs, and we came to a harmless standstill
      among a bower of leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at the trustworthy man, and smiled vaguely. He considered me for
      a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you're feelin' about halfway between 'Oh, Lord!' and
      'Thank God!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's quite it,&rdquo; said I, as he got down on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing's broke,&rdquo; said he, after a searching examination. And he indulged
      in a true Virginian expletive. &ldquo;Gentlemen, hush!&rdquo; he murmured gently,
      looking at me with his grave eyes; &ldquo;one time I got pretty near scared.
      You, Buck,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;some folks would beat you now till yu'd be
      uncertain whether yu' was a hawss or a railroad accident. I'd do it
      myself, only it wouldn't cure yu'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I now told him that I supposed he had saved both our lives. But he
      detested words of direct praise. He made some grumbling rejoinder, and led
      the horses out of the thicket. Buck, he explained to me, was a good horse,
      and so was Muggins. Both of them generally meant well, and that was the
      Judge's reason for sending them to meet me. But these broncos had their
      off days. Off days might not come very often; but when the humor seized a
      bronco, he had to have his spree. Buck would now behave himself as a horse
      should for probably two months. &ldquo;They are just like humans,&rdquo; the Virginian
      concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several cow-boys arrived on a gallop to find how many pieces of us were
      left. We returned down the hill; and when we reached my trunk, it was
      surprising to see the distance that our runaway had covered. My hat was
      also found, and we continued on our way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buck and Muggins were patterns of discretion through the rest of the
      mountains. I thought when we camped this night that it was strange Buck
      should be again allowed to graze at large, instead of being tied to a rope
      while we slept. But this was my ignorance. With the hard work that he was
      gallantly doing, the horse needed more pasture than a rope's length would
      permit him to find. Therefore he went free, and in the morning gave us but
      little trouble in catching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We crossed a river in the forenoon, and far to the north of us we saw the
      Bow Leg Mountains, pale in the bright sun. Sunk Creek flowed from their
      western side, and our two hundred and sixty-three miles began to grow a
      small thing in my eyes. Buck and Muggins, I think, knew perfectly that
      to-morrow would see them home. They recognized this region; and once they
      turned off at a fork in the road. The Virginian pulled them back rather
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to go back to Balaam's?&rdquo; he inquired of them. &ldquo;I thought you had
      more sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked, &ldquo;Who was Balaam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A maltreater of hawsses,&rdquo; replied the cow-puncher. &ldquo;His ranch is on Butte
      Creek oveh yondeh.&rdquo; And he pointed to where the diverging road melted into
      space. &ldquo;The Judge bought Buck and Muggins from him in the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he maltreats horses?&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the word all through this country. A man that will do what they
      claim Balaam does to a hawss when he's mad, ain't fit to be called human.&rdquo;
       The Virginian told me some particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I almost screamed at the horror of it, and again, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd have prob'ly done that to Buck as soon as he stopped runnin' away.
      If I caught a man doin' that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were interrupted by a sedate-looking traveller riding upon an equally
      sober horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mawnin', Taylor,&rdquo; said the Virginian, pulling up for gossip. &ldquo;Ain't you
      strayed off your range pretty far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a nice one!&rdquo; replied Mr. Taylor, stopping his horse and smiling
      amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me something I don't know,&rdquo; retorted the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold up a man at cards and rob him,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Taylor. &ldquo;Oh, the news
      has got ahead of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trampas has been hyeh explainin', has he?&rdquo; said the Virginian with a
      grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that your victim's name?&rdquo; said Mr. Taylor, facetiously. &ldquo;No, it
      wasn't him that brought the news. Say, what did you do, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that thing has got around,&rdquo; murmured the Virginian. &ldquo;Well, it wasn't
      worth such wide repawtin'.&rdquo; And he gave the simple facts to Taylor, while
      I sat wondering at the contagious powers of Rumor. Here, through this
      voiceless land, this desert, this vacuum, it had spread like a change of
      weather. &ldquo;Any news up your way?&rdquo; the Virginian concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Importance came into Mr. Taylor's countenance. &ldquo;Bear Creek is going to
      build a schoolhouse,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness gracious!&rdquo; drawled the Virginian. &ldquo;What's that for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Mr. Taylor had been married for some years. &ldquo;To educate the offspring
      of Bear Creek,&rdquo; he answered with pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Offspring of Bear Creek,&rdquo; the Virginian meditatively repeated. &ldquo;I don't
      remember noticin' much offspring. There was some white tail deer, and a
      right smart o' jack rabbits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Swintons have moved up from Drybone,&rdquo; said Mr. Taylor, always
      seriously. &ldquo;They found it no place for young children. And there's Uncle
      Carmody with six, and Ben Dow. And Westfall has become a family man, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim Westfall!&rdquo; exclaimed the Virginian. &ldquo;Him a fam'ly man! Well, if this
      hyeh Territory is goin' to get full o' fam'ly men and empty o' game, I
      believe I'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get married yourself,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Taylor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me! I ain't near reached the marriageable age. No, seh! But Uncle Hughey
      has got there at last, yu' know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Hughey!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Taylor. He had not heard this. Rumor is very
      capricious. Therefore the Virginian told him, and the family man rocked in
      his saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Build your schoolhouse,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;Uncle Hughey has qualified
      himself to subscribe to all such propositions. Got your eye on a
      schoolmarm?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      V. ENTER THE WOMAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are taking steps,&rdquo; said Mr. Taylor. &ldquo;Bear Creek ain't going to be
      hasty about a schoolmarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; assented the Virginian. &ldquo;The children wouldn't want yu' to hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Taylor was, as I have indicated, a serious family man. The problem
      of educating his children could appear to him in no light except a sober
      one. &ldquo;Bear Creek,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don't want the experience they had over at
      Calef. We must not hire an ignoramus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; assented the Virginian again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor we don't want no gad-a-way flirt,&rdquo; said Mr. Taylor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must keep her eyes on the blackboa'd,&rdquo; said the Virginian, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we can wait till we get a guaranteed article,&rdquo; said Mr. Taylor.
      &ldquo;And that's what we're going to do. It can't be this year, and it needn't
      to be. None of the kids is very old, and the schoolhouse has got to be
      built.&rdquo; He now drew a letter from his pocket, and looked at me. &ldquo;Are you
      acquainted with Miss Mary Stark Wood of Bennington, Vermont?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not acquainted with her at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's one we are thinking of. She's a correspondent with Mrs. Balaam.&rdquo;
       Taylor handed me the letter. &ldquo;She wrote that to Mrs. Balaam, and Mrs.
      Balaam said the best thing was for to let me see it and judge for myself.
      I'm taking it back to Mrs. Balaam. Maybe you can give me your opinion how
      it sizes up with the letters they write back East?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The communication was mainly of a business kind, but also personal, and
      freely written. I do not think that its writer expected it to be exhibited
      as a document. The writer wished very much that she could see the West.
      But she could not gratify this desire merely for pleasure, or she would
      long ago have accepted the kind invitation to visit Mrs. Balaam's ranch.
      Teaching school was something she would like to do, if she were fitted for
      it. &ldquo;Since the mills failed&rdquo; (the writer said) &ldquo;we have all gone to work
      and done a lot of things so that mother might keep on living in the old
      house. Yes, the salary would be a temptation. But, my dear, isn't Wyoming
      bad for the complexion? And could I sue them if mine got damaged? It is
      still admired. I could bring one male witness AT LEAST to prove that!&rdquo;
       Then the writer became businesslike again. Even if she came to feel that
      she could leave home, she did not at all know that she could teach school.
      Nor did she think it right to accept a position in which one had had no
      experience. &ldquo;I do love children, boys especially,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;My small
      nephew and I get on famously. But imagine if a whole benchful of boys
      began asking me questions that I couldn't answer! What should I do? For
      one could not spank them all, you know! And mother says that I ought not
      to teach anybody spelling, because I leave the U out of HONOR.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Altogether it was a letter which I could assure Mr. Taylor &ldquo;sized up&rdquo; very
      well with the letters written in my part of the United States. And it was
      signed, &ldquo;Your very sincere spinster, Molly Stark Wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never seen HONOR spelled with a U,&rdquo; said Mr. Taylor, over whose not
      highly civilized head certain portions of the letter had lightly passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him that some old-fashioned people still wrote the word so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either way would satisfy Bear Creek,&rdquo; said Mr. Taylor, &ldquo;if she's
      otherwise up to requirements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian was now looking over the letter musingly, and with awakened
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Your very sincere spinster,'&rdquo; he read aloud slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that means she's forty,&rdquo; said Taylor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon she is about twenty,&rdquo; said the Virginian. And again he fell to
      musing over the paper that he held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her handwriting ain't like any I've saw,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Taylor. &ldquo;But Bear
      Creek would not object to that, provided she knows 'rithmetic and George
      Washington, and them kind of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect she is not an awful sincere spinster,&rdquo; surmised the Virginian,
      still looking at the letter, still holding it as if it were some token.
    </p>
    <p>
      Has any botanist set down what the seed of love is? Has it anywhere been
      set down in how many ways this seed may be sown? In what various vessels
      of gossamer it can float across wide spaces? Or upon what different soils
      it can fall, and live unknown, and bide its time for blooming?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian handed back to Taylor the sheet of note paper where a girl
      had talked as the women he had known did not talk. If his eyes had ever
      seen such maidens, there had been no meeting of eyes; and if such maidens
      had ever spoken to him, the speech was from an established distance. But
      here was a free language, altogether new to him. It proved, however, not
      alien to his understanding, as it was alien to Mr. Taylor's.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drove onward, a mile perhaps, and then two. He had lately been full of
      words, but now he barely answered me, so that a silence fell upon both of
      us. It must have been all of ten miles that we had driven when he spoke of
      his own accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your real spinster don't speak of her lot that easy,&rdquo; he remarked. And
      presently he quoted a phrase about the complexion, &ldquo;'Could I sue them if
      mine got damaged?'&rdquo; and he smiled over this to himself, shaking his head.
      &ldquo;What would she be doing on Bear Creek?&rdquo; he next said. And finally: &ldquo;I
      reckon that witness will detain her in Vermont. And her mother'll keep
      livin' at the old house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus did the cow-puncher deliver himself, not knowing at all that the seed
      had floated across wide spaces, and was biding its time in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow we reached Sunk Creek. Judge Henry's welcome and his wife's
      would have obliterated any hardships that I had endured, and I had endured
      none at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while I saw little of the Virginian. He lapsed into his native way
      of addressing me occasionally as &ldquo;seh&rdquo;&mdash;a habit entirely repudiated
      by this land of equality. I was sorry. Our common peril during the runaway
      of Buck and Muggins had brought us to a familiarity that I hoped was
      destined to last. But I think that it would not have gone farther, save
      for a certain personage&mdash;I must call her a personage. And as I am
      indebted to her for gaining me a friend whose prejudice against me might
      never have been otherwise overcome, I shall tell you her little story, and
      how her misadventures and her fate came to bring the Virginian and me to
      an appreciation of one another. Without her, it is likely I should also
      not have heard so much of the story of the schoolmarm, and how that lady
      at last came to Bear Creek.

    <h2>
      VI. EM'LY
    </h2>
    <p>
      My personage was a hen, and she lived at the Sunk Creek Ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Henry's ranch was notable for several luxuries. He had milk, for
      example. In those days his brother ranchmen had thousands of cattle very
      often, but not a drop of milk, save the condensed variety. Therefore they
      had no butter. The Judge had plenty. Next rarest to butter and milk in the
      cattle country were eggs. But my host had chickens. Whether this was
      because he had followed cock-fighting in his early days, or whether it was
      due to Mrs. Henry, I cannot say. I only know that when I took a meal
      elsewhere, I was likely to find nothing but the eternal &ldquo;sowbelly,&rdquo; beans,
      and coffee; while at Sunk Creek the omelet and the custard were frequent.
      The passing traveller was glad to tie his horse to the fence here, and sit
      down to the Judge's table. For its fame was as wide as Wyoming. It was an
      oasis in the Territory's desolate bill-of-fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long fences of Judge Henry's home ranch began upon Sunk Creek soon
      after that stream emerged from its canyon through the Bow Leg. It was a
      place always well cared for by the owner, even in the days of his
      bachelorhood. The placid regiments of cattle lay in the cool of the
      cottonwoods by the water, or slowly moved among the sage-brush, feeding
      upon the grass that in those forever departed years was plentiful and
      tall. The steers came fat off his unenclosed range and fattened still more
      in his large pasture; while his small pasture, a field some eight miles
      square, was for several seasons given to the Judge's horses, and over this
      ample space there played and prospered the good colts which he raised from
      Paladin, his imported stallion. After he married, I have been assured that
      his wife's influence became visible in and about the house at once. Shade
      trees were planted, flowers attempted, and to the chickens was added the
      much more troublesome turkey. I, the visitor, was pressed into service
      when I arrived, green from the East. I took hold of the farmyard and began
      building a better chicken house, while the Judge was off creating meadow
      land in his gray and yellow wilderness. When any cow-boy was unoccupied,
      he would lounge over to my neighborhood, and silently regard my
      carpentering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those cow-punchers bore names of various denominations. There was Honey
      Wiggin; there was Nebrasky, and Dollar Bill, and Chalkeye. And they came
      from farms and cities, from Maine and from California. But the romance of
      American adventure had drawn them all alike to this great playground of
      young men, and in their courage, their generosity, and their amusement at
      me they bore a close resemblance to each other. Each one would silently
      observe my achievements with the hammer and the chisel. Then he would
      retire to the bunk-house, and presently I would overhear laughter. But
      this was only in the morning. In the afternoon on many days of the summer
      which I spent at the Sunk Creek Ranch I would go shooting, or ride up
      toward the entrance of the canyon and watch the men working on the
      irrigation ditches. Pleasant systems of water running in channels were
      being led through the soil, and there was a sound of rippling here and
      there among the yellow grain; the green thick alfalfa grass waved almost,
      it seemed, of its own accord, for the wind never blew; and when at evening
      the sun lay against the plain, the rift of the canyon was filled with a
      violet light, and the Bow Leg Mountains became transfigured with hues of
      floating and unimaginable color. The sun shone in a sky where never a
      cloud came, and noon was not too warm nor the dark too cool. And so for
      two months I went through these pleasant uneventful days, improving the
      chickens, an object of mirth, living in the open air, and basking in the
      perfection of content.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was justly styled a tenderfoot. Mrs. Henry had in the beginning
      endeavored to shield me from this humiliation; but when she found that I
      was inveterate in laying my inexperience of Western matters bare to all
      the world, begging to be enlightened upon rattlesnakes, prairie-dogs,
      owls, blue and willow grouse, sage-hens, how to rope a horse or tighten
      the front cinch of my saddle, and that my spirit soared into enthusiasm at
      the mere sight of so ordinary an animal as a white-tailed deer, she let me
      rush about with my firearms and made no further effort to stave off the
      ridicule that my blunders perpetually earned from the ranch hands, her own
      humorous husband, and any chance visitor who stopped for a meal or stayed
      the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not called by my name after the first feeble etiquette due to a
      stranger in his first few hours had died away. I was known simply as &ldquo;the
      tenderfoot.&rdquo; I was introduced to the neighborhood (a circle of eighty
      miles) as &ldquo;the tenderfoot.&rdquo; It was thus that Balaam, the maltreater of
      horses, learned to address me when he came a two days' journey to pay a
      visit. And it was this name and my notorious helplessness that bid fair to
      end what relations I had with the Virginian. For when Judge Henry
      ascertained that nothing could prevent me from losing myself, that it was
      not uncommon for me to saunter out after breakfast with a gun and in
      thirty minutes cease to know north from south, he arranged for my
      protection. He detailed an escort for me; and the escort was once more the
      trustworthy man! The poor Virginian was taken from his work and his
      comrades and set to playing nurse for me. And for a while this humiliation
      ate into his untamed soul. It was his lugubrious lot to accompany me in my
      rambles, preside over my blunders, and save me from calamitously passing
      into the next world. He bore it in courteous silence, except when speaking
      was necessary. He would show me the lower ford, which I could never find
      for myself, generally mistaking a quicksand for it. He would tie my horse
      properly. He would recommend me not to shoot my rifle at a white-tailed
      deer in the particular moment that the outfit wagon was passing behind the
      animal on the further side of the brush. There was seldom a day that he
      was not obliged to hasten and save me from sudden death or from ridicule,
      which is worse. Yet never once did he lose his patience and his gentle,
      slow voice, and apparently lazy manner remained the same, whether we were
      sitting at lunch together, or up in the mountain during a hunt, or whether
      he was bringing me back my horse, which had run away because I had again
      forgotten to throw the reins over his head and let them trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll always stand if yu' do that,&rdquo; the Virginian would say. &ldquo;See how my
      hawss stays right quiet yondeh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After such admonition he would say no more to me. But this tame nursery
      business was assuredly gall to him. For though utterly a man in
      countenance and in his self-possession and incapacity to be put at a loss,
      he was still boyishly proud of his wild calling, and wore his leather
      straps and jingled his spurs with obvious pleasure. His tiger limberness
      and his beauty were rich with unabated youth; and that force which lurked
      beneath his surface must often have curbed his intolerance of me. In spite
      of what I knew must be his opinion of me, the tenderfoot, my liking for
      him grew, and I found his silent company more and more agreeable. That he
      had spells of talking, I had already learned at Medicine Bow. But his
      present taciturnity might almost have effaced this impression, had I not
      happened to pass by the bunk-house one evening after dark, when Honey
      Wiggin and the rest of the cow-boys were gathered inside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon the Virginian and I had gone duck shooting. We had found
      several in a beaver dam, and I had killed two as they sat close together;
      but they floated against the breastwork of sticks out in the water some
      four feet deep, where the escaping current might carry them down the
      stream. The Judge's red setter had not accompanied us, because she was
      expecting a family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't want her along anyways,&rdquo; the cow-puncher had explained to me.
      &ldquo;She runs around mighty irresponsible, and she'll stand a prairie-dog
      'bout as often as she'll stand a bird. She's a triflin' animal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My anxiety to own the ducks caused me to pitch into the water with all my
      clothes on, and subsequently crawl out a slippery, triumphant, weltering
      heap. The Virginian's serious eyes had rested upon this spectacle of mud;
      but he expressed nothing, as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ain't overly good eatin',&rdquo; he observed, tying the birds to his
      saddle. &ldquo;They're divers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divers!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Why didn't they dive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon they was young ones and hadn't experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, crestfallen, but attempting to be humorous, &ldquo;I did the
      diving myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Virginian made no comment. He handed me my double-barrelled
      English gun, which I was about to leave deserted on the ground behind me,
      and we rode home in our usual silence, the mean little white-breasted,
      sharp-billed divers dangling from his saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the bunk-house that he took his revenge. As I passed I heard his
      gentle voice silently achieving some narrative to an attentive audience,
      and just as I came by the open window where he sat on his bed in shirt and
      drawers, his back to me, I heard his concluding words, &ldquo;And the hat on his
      haid was the one mark showed yu' he weren't a snappin'-turtle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The anecdote met with instantaneous success, and I hurried away into the
      dark. The next morning I was occupied with the chickens. Two hens were
      fighting to sit on some eggs that a third was daily laying, and which I
      did not want hatched, and for the third time I had kicked Em'ly off seven
      potatoes she had rolled together and was determined to raise I know not
      what sort of family from. She was shrieking about the hen-house as the
      Virginian came in to observe (I suspect) what I might be doing now that
      could be useful for him to mention in the bunk-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood awhile, and at length said, &ldquo;We lost our best rooster when Mrs.
      Henry came to live hyeh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I paid no attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a right elegant Dominicker,&rdquo; he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt a little riled about the snapping-turtle, and showed no interest in
      what he was saying, but continued my functions among the hens. This
      unusual silence of mine seemed to elicit unusual speech from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yu' see, that rooster he'd always lived round hyeh when the Judge was a
      bachelor, and he never seen no ladies or any persons wearing female
      gyarments. You ain't got rheumatism, seh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckoned maybe them little odd divers yu' got damp goin' afteh&mdash;&rdquo;
       He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not in the least, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yu' seemed sort o' grave this mawnin', and I'm cert'nly glad it ain't
      them divers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the rooster?&rdquo; I inquired finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, him! He weren't raised where he could see petticoats. Mrs. Henry she
      come hyeh from the railroad with the Judge afteh dark. Next mawnin' early
      she walked out to view her new home, and the rooster was a-feedin' by the
      door, and he seen her. Well, seh, he screeched that awful I run out of the
      bunk-house; and he jus' went over the fence and took down Sunk Creek
      shoutin' fire, right along. He has never come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a hen over there now that has no judgment,&rdquo; I said, indicating
      Em'ly. She had got herself outside the house, and was on the bars of a
      corral, her vociferations reduced to an occasional squawk. I told him
      about the potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knowed her name before,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;That runaway rooster, he hated
      her. And she hated him same as she hates 'em all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I named her myself,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;after I came to notice her particularly.
      There's an old maid at home who's charitable, and belongs to the Cruelty
      to Animals, and she never knows whether she had better cross in front of a
      street car or wait. I named the hen after her. Does she ever lay eggs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian had not &ldquo;troubled his haid&rdquo; over the poultry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't believe she knows how. I think she came near being a
      rooster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's sure manly-lookin',&rdquo; said the Virginian. We had walked toward the
      corral, and he was now scrutinizing Em'ly with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was an egregious fowl. She was huge and gaunt, with great yellow beak,
      and she stood straight and alert in the manner of responsible people.
      There was something wrong with her tail. It slanted far to one side, one
      feather in it twice as long as the rest. Feathers on her breast there were
      none. These had been worn entirely off by her habit of sitting upon
      potatoes and other rough abnormal objects. And this lent to her appearance
      an air of being décollete, singularly at variance with her otherwise
      prudish ensemble. Her eye was remarkably bright, but somehow it had an
      outraged expression. It was as if she went about the world perpetually
      scandalized over the doings that fell beneath her notice. Her legs were
      blue, long, and remarkably stout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'd ought to wear knickerbockers,&rdquo; murmured the Virginian. &ldquo;She'd look
      a heap better 'n some o' them college students. And she'll set on
      potatoes, yu' say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She thinks she can hatch out anything. I've found her with onions, and
      last Tuesday I caught her on two balls of soap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon the tall cow-puncher and I rode out to get an antelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an hour, during which he was completely taciturn, he said: &ldquo;I reckon
      maybe this hyeh lonesome country ain't been healthy for Em'ly to live in.
      It ain't for some humans. Them old trappers in the mountains gets skewed
      in the haid mighty often, an' talks out loud when nobody's nigher 'n a
      hundred miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Em'ly has not been solitary,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;There are forty chickens here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It don't explain her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell silent again, riding beside me, easy and indolent in the saddle.
      His long figure looked so loose and inert that the swift, light spring he
      made to the ground seemed an impossible feat. He had seen an antelope
      where I saw none.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a shot yourself,&rdquo; I urged him, as he motioned me to be quick. &ldquo;You
      never shoot when I'm with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't hyeh for that,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Now you've let him get away on
      yu'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The antelope had in truth departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said to my protest, &ldquo;I can hit them things any day. What's your
      notion as to Em'ly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't account for her,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said musingly, and then his mind took one of those particular
      turns that made me love him, &ldquo;Taylor ought to see her. She'd be just the
      schoolmarm for Bear Creek!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's not much like the eating-house lady at Medicine Bow,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a hilarious chuckle. &ldquo;No, Em'ly knows nothing o' them joys. So yu'
      have no notion about her? Well, I've got one. I reckon maybe she was
      hatched after a big thunderstorm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a big thunderstorm!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Don't yu' know about them, and what they'll do to aiggs? A big case
      o' lightnin' and thunder will addle aiggs and keep 'em from hatchin'. And
      I expect one came along, and all the other aiggs of Em'ly's set didn't
      hatch out, but got plumb addled, and she happened not to get addled that
      far, and so she just managed to make it through. But she cert'nly ain't
      got a strong haid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear she has not,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty hon'ble intentions,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;If she can't make out to lay
      anything, she wants to hatch somethin', and be a mother anyways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what relation the law considers that a hen is to the chicken she
      hatched but did not lay?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian made no reply to this frivolous suggestion. He was gazing
      over the wide landscape gravely and with apparent inattention. He
      invariably saw game before I did, and was off his horse and crouched among
      the sage while I was still getting my left foot clear of the stirrup. I
      succeeded in killing an antelope, and we rode home with the head and hind
      quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It's sure the thunder, and not the lonesomeness. How do
      yu' like the lonesomeness yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him that I liked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not live without it now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This has got into my system.&rdquo;
       He swept his hand out at the vast space of world. &ldquo;I went back home to see
      my folks onced. Mother was dyin' slow, and she wanted me. I stayed a year.
      But them Virginia mountains could please me no more. Afteh she was gone, I
      told my brothers and sisters good-by. We like each other well enough, but
      I reckon I'll not go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We found Em'ly seated upon a collection of green California peaches, which
      the Judge had brought from the railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind her any more,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I'm sorry for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been sorry for her right along,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;She does hate
      the roosters so.&rdquo; And he said that he was making a collection of every
      class of object which he found her treating as eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Em'ly's egg-industry was terminated abruptly one morning, and her
      unquestioned energies diverted to a new channel. A turkey which had been
      sitting in the root-house appeared with twelve children, and a family of
      bantams occurred almost simultaneously. Em'ly was importantly scratching
      the soil inside Paladin's corral when the bantam tribe of newly born came
      by down the lane, and she caught sight of them through the bars. She
      crossed the corral at a run, and intercepted two of the chicks that were
      trailing somewhat behind their real mamma. These she undertook to
      appropriate, and assumed a high tone with the bantam, who was the smaller,
      and hence obliged to retreat with her still numerous family. I interfered,
      and put matters straight; but the adjustment was only temporary. In an
      hour I saw Em'ly immensely busy with two more bantams, leading them about
      and taking a care of them which I must admit seemed perfectly efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now came the first incident that made me suspect her to be demented.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had proceeded with her changelings behind the kitchen, where one of
      the irrigation ditches ran under the fence from the hay-field to supply
      the house with water. Some distance along this ditch inside the field were
      the twelve turkeys in the short, recently cut stubble. Again Em'ly set off
      instantly like a deer. She left the dismayed bantams behind her. She
      crossed the ditch with one jump of her stout blue legs, flew over the
      grass, and was at once among the turkeys, where, with an instinct of
      maternity as undiscriminating as it was reckless, she attempted to huddle
      some of them away. But this other mamma was not a bantam, and in a few
      moments Em'ly was entirely routed in her attempt to acquire a new variety
      of family.
    </p>
    <p>
      This spectacle was witnessed by the Virginian and myself, and it overcame
      him. He went speechless across to the bunk-house, by himself, and sat on
      his bed, while I took the abandoned bantams back to their own circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have often wondered what the other fowls thought of all this. Some
      impression it certainly did make upon them. The notion may seem out of
      reason to those who have never closely attended to other animals than man;
      but I am convinced that any community which shares some of our instincts
      will share some of the resulting feelings, and that birds and beasts have
      conventions, the breach of which startles them. If there be anything in
      evolution, this would seem inevitable. At all events, the chicken-house
      was upset during the following several days. Em'ly disturbed now the
      bantams and now the turkeys, and several of these latter had died, though
      I will not go so far as to say that this was the result of her misplaced
      attentions. Nevertheless, I was seriously thinking of locking her up till
      the broods should be a little older, when another event happened, and all
      was suddenly at peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge's setter came in one morning, wagging her tail. She had had her
      puppies, and she now took us to where they were housed, in between the
      floor of a building and the hollow ground. Em'ly was seated on the whole
      litter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said to the Judge, &ldquo;I am not surprised. She is capable of
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her new choice of offspring, this hen had at length encountered an
      unworthy parent. The setter was bored by her own puppies. She found the
      hole under the house an obscure and monotonous residence compared with the
      dining room, and our company more stimulating and sympathetic than that of
      her children. A much-petted contact with our superior race had developed
      her dog intelligence above its natural level, and turned her into an
      unnatural, neglectful mother, who was constantly forgetting her nursery
      for worldly pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      At certain periods of the day she repaired to the puppies and fed them,
      but came away when this perfunctory ceremony was accomplished; and she was
      glad enough to have a governess bring them up. She made no quarrel with
      Em'ly, and the two understood each other perfectly. I have never seen
      among animals any arrangement so civilized and so perverted. It made Em'ly
      perfectly happy. To see her sitting all day jealously spreading her wings
      over some blind puppies was sufficiently curious; but when they became
      large enough to come out from under the house and toddle about in the
      proud hen's wake, I longed for some distinguished naturalist. I felt that
      our ignorance made us inappropriate spectators of such a phenomenon. Em'ly
      scratched and clucked, and the puppies ran to her, pawed her with their
      fat limp little legs, and retreated beneath her feathers in their games of
      hide and seek. Conceive, if you can, what confusion must have reigned in
      their infant minds as to who the setter was!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon they think she's the wet-nurse,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the puppies grew to be boisterous, I perceived that Em'ly's mission
      was approaching its end. They were too heavy for her, and their increasing
      scope of playfulness was not in her line. Once or twice they knocked her
      over, upon which she arose and pecked them severely, and they retired to a
      safe distance, and sitting in a circle, yapped at her. I think they began
      to suspect that she was only a hen after all. So Em'ly resigned with an
      indifference which surprised me, until I remembered that if it had been
      chickens, she would have ceased to look after them by this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here she was again &ldquo;out of a job,&rdquo; as the Virginian said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's raised them puppies for that triflin' setter, and now she'll be
      huntin' around for something else useful to do that ain't in her
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now there were other broods of chickens to arrive in the hen-house, and I
      did not desire any more bantam and turkey performances. So, to avoid
      confusion, I played a trick upon Em'ly. I went down to Sunk Creek and
      fetched some smooth, oval stones. She was quite satisfied with these, and
      passed a quiet day with them in a box. This was not fair, the Virginian
      asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't going to jus' leave her fooled that a-way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not see why not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, she raised them puppies all right. Ain't she showed she knows how to
      be a mother anyways? Em'ly ain't going to get her time took up for nothing
      while I'm round hyeh,&rdquo; said the cow-puncher.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid a gentle hold of Em'ly and tossed her to the ground. She, of
      course, rushed out among the corrals in a great state of nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see what good you do meddling,&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this he deigned no reply, but removed the unresponsive stones from the
      straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if they ain't right warm!&rdquo; he exclaimed plaintively. &ldquo;The poor,
      deluded son-of-a-gun!&rdquo; And with this unusual description of a lady, he
      sent the stones sailing like a line of birds. &ldquo;I'm regular getting stuck
      on Em'ly,&rdquo; continued the Virginian. &ldquo;Yu' needn't to laugh. Don't yu' see
      she's got sort o' human feelin's and desires? I always knowed hawsses was
      like people, and my collie, of course. It is kind of foolish, I expect,
      but that hen's goin' to have a real aigg di-rectly, right now, to set on.&rdquo;
       With this he removed one from beneath another hen. &ldquo;We'll have Em'ly raise
      this hyeh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so she can put in her time profitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not accomplished at once; for Em'ly, singularly enough, would not
      consent to stay in the box whence she had been routed. At length we found
      another retreat for her, and in these new surroundings, with a new piece
      of work for her to do, Em'ly sat on the one egg which the Virginian had so
      carefully provided for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, as in all genuine tragedies, was the stroke of Fate wrought by
      chance and the best intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Em'ly began sitting on Friday afternoon near sundown. Early next morning
      my sleep was gradually dispersed by a sound unearthly and continuous. Now
      it dwindled, receding to a distance; again it came near, took a turn,
      drifted to the other side of the house; then, evidently, whatever it was,
      passed my door close, and I jumped upright in my bed. The high, tense
      strain of vibration, nearly, but not quite, a musical note, was like the
      threatening scream of machinery, though weaker, and I bounded out of the
      house in my pajamas.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was Em'ly, dishevelled, walking wildly about, her one egg
      miraculously hatched within ten hours. The little lonely yellow ball of
      down went cheeping along behind, following its mother as best it could.
      What, then, had happened to the established period of incubation? For an
      instant the thing was like a portent, and I was near joining Em'ly in her
      horrid surprise, when I saw how it all was. The Virginian had taken an egg
      from a hen which had already been sitting for three weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dressed in haste, hearing Em'ly's distracted outcry. It steadily
      sounded, without perceptible pause for breath, and marked her erratic
      journey back and forth through stables, lanes, and corrals. The shrill
      disturbance brought all of us out to see her, and in the hen-house I
      discovered the new brood making its appearance punctually.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this natural explanation could not be made to the crazed hen. She
      continued to scour the premises, her slant tail and its one preposterous
      feather waving as she aimlessly went, her stout legs stepping high with an
      unnatural motion, her head lifted nearly off her neck, and in her
      brilliant yellow eye an expression of more than outrage at this
      overturning of a natural law. Behind her, entirely ignored and neglected,
      trailed the little progeny. She never looked at it. We went about our
      various affairs, and all through the clear, sunny day that unending
      metallic scream pervaded the premises. The Virginian put out food and
      water for her, but she tasted nothing. I am glad to say that the little
      chicken did. I do not think that the hen's eyes could see, except in the
      way that sleep-walkers' do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heat went out of the air, and in the canyon the violet light began to
      show. Many hours had gone, but Em'ly never ceased. Now she suddenly flew
      up in a tree and sat there with her noise still going; but it had risen
      lately several notes into a slim, acute level of terror, and was not like
      machinery any more, nor like any sound I ever heard before or since. Below
      the tree stood the bewildered little chicken, cheeping, and making tiny
      jumps to reach its mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Virginian, &ldquo;it's comical. Even her aigg acted different
      from anybody else's.&rdquo; He paused, and looked across the wide, mellowing
      plain with the expression of easy-going gravity so common with him. Then
      he looked at Em'ly in the tree and the yellow chicken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't so damned funny,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went in to supper, and I came out to find the hen lying on the ground,
      dead. I took the chicken to the family in the hen-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, it was not altogether funny any more. And I did not think less of the
      Virginian when I came upon him surreptitiously digging a little hole in
      the field for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have buried some citizens here and there,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I have
      respected less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when the time came for me to leave Sunk Creek, my last word to the
      Virginian was, &ldquo;Don't forget Em'ly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't likely to,&rdquo; responded the cow-puncher. &ldquo;She is just one o' them
      parables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Save when he fell into his native idioms (which, they told me, his
      wanderings had well-nigh obliterated until that year's visit to his home
      again revived them in his speech), he had now for a long while dropped the
      &ldquo;seh,&rdquo; and all other barriers between us. We were thorough friends, and
      had exchanged many confidences both of the flesh and of the spirit. He
      even went the length of saying that he would write me the Sunk Creek news
      if I would send him a line now and then. I have many letters from him now.
      Their spelling came to be faultless, and in the beginning was little worse
      than George Washington's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge himself drove me to the railroad by another way&mdash;across the
      Bow Leg Mountains, and south through Balaam's Ranch and Drybone to Rock
      Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be very homesick,&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and pull the latch-string whenever you please,&rdquo; he bade me. I wished
      that I might! No lotus land ever cast its spell upon man's heart more than
      Wyoming had enchanted mine.

    <h2>
      VII. THROUGH TWO SNOWS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Friend [thus in the spring the Virginian wrote me], Yours received.
      It must be a poor thing to be sick. That time I was shot at Caada de Oro
      would have made me sick if it had been a littel lower or if I was much of
      a drinking man. You will be well if you give over city life and take a
      hunt with me about August or say September for then the elk will be out of
      the velvett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things do not please me here just now and I am going to settel it by
      vamosing. But I would be glad to see you. It would be pleasure not
      business for me to show you plenty elk and get you strong. I am not
      crybabying to the Judge or making any kick about things. He will want me
      back after he has swallowed a litter tincture of time. It is the best dose
      I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now to answer your questions. Yes the Emmily hen might have ate loco weed
      if hens do. I never saw anything but stock and horses get poisoned with
      loco weed. No the school is not built yet. They are always big talkers on
      Bear Creek. No I have not seen Steve. He is around but I am sorry for him.
      Yes I have been to Medicine Bow. I had the welcom I wanted. Do you
      remember a man I played poker and he did not like it? He is working on the
      upper ranch near Ten Sleep. He does not amount to a thing except with
      weaklings. Uncle Hewie has twins. The boys got him vexed some about it,
      but I think they are his. Now that is all I know to-day and I would like
      to see you poco presently as they say at Los Cruces. There's no sense in
      you being sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of this letter discussed the best meeting point for us should I
      decide to join him for a hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      That hunt was made, and during the weeks of its duration something was
      said to explain a little more fully the Virginian's difficulty at the Sunk
      Creek Ranch, and his reason for leaving his excellent employer the Judge.
      Not much was said, to be sure; the Virginian seldom spent many words upon
      his own troubles. But it appeared that owing to some jealousy of him on
      the part of the foreman, or the assistant foreman, he found himself
      continually doing another man's work, but under circumstances so skilfully
      arranged that he got neither credit nor pay for it. He would not stoop to
      telling tales out of school. Therefore his ready and prophetic mind
      devised the simple expedient of going away altogether. He calculated that
      Judge Henry would gradually perceive there was a connection between his
      departure and the cessation of the satisfactory work. After a judicious
      interval it was his plan to appear again in the neighborhood of Sunk Creek
      and await results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning Steve he would say no more than he had written. But it was
      plain that for some cause this friendship had ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Money for his services during the hunt he positively declined to accept,
      asserting that he had not worked enough to earn his board. And the
      expedition ended in an untravelled corner of the Yellowstone Park, near
      Pitchstone Canyon, where he and young Lin McLean and others were witnesses
      of a sad and terrible drama that has been elsewhere chronicled.
    </p>
    <p>
      His prophetic mind had foreseen correctly the shape of events at Sunk
      Creek. The only thing that it had not foreseen was the impression to be
      made upon the Judge's mind by his conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the close of that winter, Judge and Mrs. Henry visited the East.
      Through them a number of things became revealed. The Virginian was back at
      Sunk Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Mrs. Henry, &ldquo;he would never have left you if I had had my way,
      Judge H.!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Madam Judge,&rdquo; retorted her husband; &ldquo;I am aware of that. For you have
      always appreciated a fine appearance in a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly have,&rdquo; confessed the lady, mirthfully. &ldquo;And the way he used
      to come bringing my horse, with the ridges of his black hair so carefully
      brushed and that blue spotted handkerchief tied so effectively round his
      throat, was something that I missed a great deal after he went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my dear, for this warning. I have plans that will keep him
      absent quite constantly for the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then they spoke less flightily. &ldquo;I always knew,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;that
      you had found a treasure when that man came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge laughed. &ldquo;When it dawned on me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how cleverly he
      caused me to learn the value of his services by depriving me of them, I
      doubted whether it was safe to take him back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe, my dear. Because I'm afraid he is pretty nearly as shrewd as I am.
      And that's rather dangerous in a subordinate.&rdquo; The Judge laughed again.
      &ldquo;But his action regarding the man they call Steve has made me feel easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then it came out that the Virginian was supposed to have discovered in
      some way that Steve had fallen from the grace of that particular honesty
      which respects another man's cattle. It was not known for certain. But
      calves had begun to disappear in Cattle Land, and cows had been found
      killed. And calves with one brand upon them had been found with mothers
      that bore the brand of another owner. This industry was taking root in
      Cattle Land, and of those who practised it, some were beginning to be
      suspected. Steve was not quite fully suspected yet. But that the Virginian
      had parted company with him was definitely known. And neither man would
      talk about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the further news that the Bear Creek schoolhouse at length stood
      complete, floor, walls, and roof; and that a lady from Bennington,
      Vermont, a friend of Mrs. Balaam's, had quite suddenly decided that she
      would try her hand at instructing the new generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge and Mrs. Henry knew this because Mrs. Balaam had told them of
      her disappointment that she would be absent from the ranch on Butte Creek
      when her friend arrived, and therefore unable to entertain her. The
      friend's decision had been quite suddenly made, and must form the subject
      of the next chapter.

    <h2>
      VIII. THE SINCERE SPINSTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      I do not know with which of the two estimates&mdash;Mr. Taylor's or the
      Virginian's&mdash;you agreed. Did you think that Miss Mary Stark Wood of
      Bennington, Vermont, was forty years of age? That would have been an
      error. At the time she wrote the letter to Mrs. Balaam, of which letter
      certain portions have been quoted in these pages, she was in her
      twenty-first year; or, to be more precise, she had been twenty some eight
      months previous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it is not usual for young ladies of twenty to contemplate a journey
      of nearly two thousand miles to a country where Indians and wild animals
      live unchained, unless they are to make such journey in company with a
      protector, or are going to a protector's arms at the other end. Nor is
      school teaching on Bear Creek a usual ambition for such young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Mary Stark Wood was not a usual young lady for two reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, there was her descent. Had she so wished, she could have belonged
      to any number of those patriotic societies of which our American ears have
      grown accustomed to hear so much. She could have been enrolled in the
      Boston Tea Party, the Ethan Allen Ticonderogas, the Green Mountain
      Daughters, the Saratoga Sacred Circle, and the Confederated Colonial
      Chatelaines. She traced direct descent from the historic lady whose name
      she bore, that Molly Stark who was not a widow after the battle where her
      lord, her Captain John, battled so bravely as to send his name thrilling
      down through the blood of generations of schoolboys. This ancestress was
      her chief claim to be a member of those shining societies which I have
      enumerated. But she had been willing to join none of them, although
      invitations to do so were by no means lacking. I cannot tell you her
      reason. Still, I can tell you this. When these societies were much spoken
      of in her presence, her very sprightly countenance became more sprightly,
      and she added her words of praise or respect to the general chorus. But
      when she received an invitation to join one of these bodies, her
      countenance, as she read the missive, would assume an expression which was
      known to her friends as &ldquo;sticking her nose in the air.&rdquo; I do not think
      that Molly's reason for refusing to join could have been a truly good one.
      I should add that her most precious possession&mdash;a treasure which
      accompanied her even if she went away for only one night's absence&mdash;was
      an heirloom, a little miniature portrait of the old Molly Stark, painted
      when that far-off dame must have been scarce more than twenty. And when
      each summer the young Molly went to Dunbarton, New Hampshire, to pay her
      established family visit to the last survivors of her connection who bore
      the name of Stark, no word that she heard in the Dunbarton houses pleased
      her so much as when a certain great-aunt would take her by the hand, and,
      after looking with fond intentness at her, pronounce: &ldquo;My dear, you're
      getting more like the General's wife every year you live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean my nose,&rdquo; Molly would then reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, child. You have the family length of nose, and I've never heard
      that it has disgraced us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't think I'm tall enough for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, run to your room, and dress for tea. The Starks have always
      been punctual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And after this annual conversation, Molly would run to her room, and there
      in its privacy, even at the risk of falling below the punctuality of the
      Starks, she would consult two objects for quite a minute before she began
      to dress. These objects, as you have already correctly guessed, were the
      miniature of the General's wife and the looking glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for Miss Molly Stark Wood's descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second reason why she was not a usual girl was her character. This
      character was the result of pride and family pluck battling with family
      hardship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just one year before she was to be presented to the world&mdash;not the
      great metropolitan world, but a world that would have made her welcome and
      done her homage at its little dances and little dinners in Troy and
      Rutland and Burlington&mdash;fortune had turned her back upon the Woods.
      Their possessions had never been great ones; but they had sufficed. From
      generation to generation the family had gone to school like gentlefolk,
      dressed like gentlefolk, used the speech and ways of gentlefolk, and as
      gentlefolk lived and died. And now the mills failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of thinking about her first evening dress, Molly found pupils to
      whom she could give music lessons. She found handkerchiefs that she could
      embroider with initials. And she found fruit that she could make into
      preserves. That machine called the typewriter was then in existence, but
      the day of women typewriters had as yet scarcely begun to dawn, else I
      think Molly would have preferred this occupation to the handkerchiefs and
      the preserves.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were people in Bennington who &ldquo;wondered how Miss Wood could go about
      from house to house teaching the piano, and she a lady.&rdquo; There always have
      been such people, I suppose, because the world must always have a rubbish
      heap. But we need not dwell upon them further than to mention one other
      remark of theirs regarding Molly. They all with one voice declared that
      Sam Bannett was good enough for anybody who did fancy embroidery at five
      cents a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say he had a great-grandmother quite as good as hers,&rdquo; remarked
      Mrs. Flynt, the wife of the Baptist minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's entirely possible,&rdquo; returned the Episcopal rector of Hoosic, &ldquo;only
      we don't happen to know who she was.&rdquo; The rector was a friend of Molly's.
      After this little observation, Mrs. Flynt said no more, but continued her
      purchases in the store where she and the rector had happened to find
      themselves together. Later she stated to a friend that she had always
      thought the Episcopal Church a snobbish one, and now she knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So public opinion went on being indignant over Molly's conduct. She could
      stoop to work for money, and yet she pretended to hold herself above the
      most rising young man in Hoosic Falls, and all just because there was a
      difference in their grandmothers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this the reason at the bottom of it? The very bottom? I cannot be
      certain, because I have never been a girl myself. Perhaps she thought that
      work is not a stooping, and that marriage may be. Perhaps&mdash;But all I
      really know is that Molly Wood continued cheerfully to embroider the
      handkerchiefs, make the preserves, teach the pupils&mdash;and firmly to
      reject Sam Bannett.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it went on until she was twenty. There certain members of her family
      began to tell her how rich Sam was going to be&mdash;was, indeed, already.
      It was at this time that she wrote Mrs. Balaam her doubts and her desires
      as to migrating to Bear Creek. It was at this time also that her face grew
      a little paler, and her friends thought that she was overworked, and Mrs.
      Flynt feared she was losing her looks. It was at this time, too, that she
      grew very intimate with that great-aunt over at Dunbarton, and from her
      received much comfort and strengthening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;especially if you can't love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do like him,&rdquo; said Molly; &ldquo;and he is very kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said the old lady again. &ldquo;When I die, you'll have something&mdash;and
      that will not be long now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly flung her arms around her aunt, and stopped her words with a kiss.
      And then one winter afternoon, two years later, came the last straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front door of the old house had shut. Out of it had stepped the
      persistent suitor. Mrs. Flynt watched him drive away in his smart sleigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That girl is a fool!&rdquo; she said furiously; and she came away from her
      bedroom window where she had posted herself for observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the old house a door had also shut. This was the door of Molly's
      own room. And there she sat, in floods of tears. For she could not bear to
      hurt a man who loved her with all the power of love that was in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about twilight when her door opened, and an elderly lady came
      softly in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she ventured, &ldquo;and you were not able&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother!&rdquo; cried the girl, &ldquo;have you come to say that too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day Miss Wood had become very hard. In three weeks she had
      accepted the position on Bear Creek. In two months she started,
      heart-heavy, but with a spirit craving the unknown.

      IX. THE SPINSTER MEETS THE UNKNOWN
    </h2>
    <p>
      On a Monday noon a small company of horsemen strung out along the trail
      from Sunk Creek to gather cattle over their allotted sweep of range.
      Spring was backward, and they, as they rode galloping and gathering upon
      the cold week's work, cursed cheerily and occasionally sang. The Virginian
      was grave in bearing and of infrequent speech; but he kept a song going&mdash;a
      matter of some seventy-nine verses. Seventy-eight were quite unprintable,
      and rejoiced his brother cow-punchers monstrously. They, knowing him to be
      a singular man, forebore ever to press him, and awaited his own humor,
      lest he should weary of the lyric; and when after a day of silence
      apparently saturnine, he would lift his gentle voice and begin:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;If you go to monkey with my Looloo girl,
      I'll tell you what I'll do:
      I'll cyarve your heart with my razor, AND
      I'll shoot you with my pistol, too&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      then they would stridently take up each last line, and keep it going
      three, four, ten times, and kick holes in the ground to the swing of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the levels of Bear Creek that reach like inlets among the promontories
      of the lonely hills, they came upon the schoolhouse, roofed and ready for
      the first native Wyoming crop. It symbolized the dawn of a neighborhood,
      and it brought a change into the wilderness air. The feel of it struck
      cold upon the free spirits of the cow-punchers, and they told each other
      that, what with women and children and wire fences, this country would not
      long be a country for men. They stopped for a meal at an old comrade's.
      They looked over his gate, and there he was pattering among garden
      furrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pickin' nosegays?&rdquo; inquired the Virginian and the old comrade asked if
      they could not recognize potatoes except in the dish. But he grinned
      sheepishly at them, too, because they knew that he had not always lived in
      a garden. Then he took them into his house, where they saw an object
      crawling on the floor with a handful of sulphur matches. He began to
      remove the matches, but stopped in alarm at the vociferous result; and his
      wife looked in from the kitchen to caution him about humoring little
      Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she beheld the matches she was aghast but when she saw her baby grow
      quiet in the arms of the Virginian, she smiled at that cow-puncher and
      returned to her kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Virginian slowly spoke again: &ldquo;How many little strangers have yu'
      got, James?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My! Ain't it most three years since yu' maried? Yu' mustn't let time
      creep ahaid o' yu', James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father once more grinned at his guests, who themselves turned sheepish
      and polite; for Mrs. Westfall came in, brisk and hearty, and set the meat
      upon the table. After that, it was she who talked. The guests ate
      scrupulously, muttering, &ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; and &ldquo;No, ma'am,&rdquo; in their plates,
      while their hostess told them of increasing families upon Bear Creek, and
      the expected school-teacher, and little Alfred's early teething, and how
      it was time for all of them to become husbands like James. The bachelors
      of the saddle listened, always diffident, but eating heartily to the end;
      and soon after they rode away in a thoughtful clump. The wives of Bear
      Creek were few as yet, and the homes scattered; the schoolhouse was only a
      sprig on the vast face of a world of elk and bear and uncertain Indians;
      but that night, when the earth near the fire was littered with the
      cow-punchers' beds, the Virginian was heard drawling to himself: &ldquo;Alfred
      and Christopher. Oh, sugar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They found pleasure in the delicately chosen shade of this oath. He also
      recited to them a new verse about how he took his Looloo girl to the
      schoolhouse for to learn her A B C; and as it was quite original and
      unprintable, the camp laughed and swore joyfully, and rolled in its
      blankets to sleep under the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a Monday noon likewise (for things will happen so) some tearful
      people in petticoats waved handkerchiefs at a train that was just leaving
      Bennington, Vermont. A girl's face smiled back at them once, and withdrew
      quickly, for they must not see the smile die away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had with her a little money, a few clothes, and in her mind a rigid
      determination neither to be a burden to her mother nor to give in to that
      mother's desires. Absence alone would enable her to carry out this
      determination. Beyond these things, she possessed not much except
      spelling-books, a colonial miniature, and that craving for the unknown
      which has been mentioned. If the ancestors that we carry shut up inside us
      take turns in dictating to us our actions and our state of mind,
      undoubtedly Grandmother Stark was empress of Molly's spirit upon this
      Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Hoosic Junction, which came soon, she passed the up-train bound back to
      her home, and seeing the engineer and the conductor,&mdash;faces that she
      knew well,&mdash;her courage nearly failed her, and she shut her eyes
      against this glimpse of the familiar things that she was leaving. To keep
      herself steady she gripped tightly a little bunch of flowers in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But something caused her eyes to open; and there before her stood Sam
      Bannett, asking if he might accompany her so far as Rotterdam Junction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she told him with a severity born from the struggle she was making
      with her grief. &ldquo;Not a mile with me. Not to Eagle Bridge. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Sam&mdash;what did he do? He obeyed her, I should like to be sorry for
      him. But obedience was not a lover's part here. He hesitated, the golden
      moment hung hovering, the conductor cried &ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; the train went,
      and there on the platform stood obedient Sam, with his golden moment gone
      like a butterfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Rotterdam Junction, which was some forty minutes farther, Molly Wood
      sat bravely up in the through car, dwelling upon the unknown. She thought
      that she had attained it in Ohio, on Tuesday morning, and wrote a letter
      about it to Bennington. On Wednesday afternoon she felt sure, and wrote a
      letter much more picturesque. But on the following day, after breakfast at
      North Platte, Nebraska, she wrote a very long letter indeed, and told them
      that she had seen a black pig on a white pile of buffalo bones, catching
      drops of water in the air as they fell from the railroad tank. She also
      wrote that trees were extraordinarily scarce. Each hour westward from the
      pig confirmed this opinion, and when she left the train at Rock Creek,
      late upon that fourth night,&mdash;in those days the trains were slower,&mdash;she
      knew that she had really attained the unknown, and sent an expensive
      telegram to say that she was quite well.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six in the morning the stage drove away into the sage-brush, with her
      as its only passenger; and by sundown she had passed through some of the
      primitive perils of the world. The second team, virgin to harness, and
      displeased with this novelty, tried to take it off, and went down to the
      bottom of a gully on its eight hind legs, while Miss Wood sat mute and
      unflinching beside the driver. Therefore he, when it was over, and they on
      the proper road again, invited her earnestly to be his wife during many of
      the next fifteen miles, and told her of his snug cabin and his horses and
      his mine. Then she got down and rode inside, Independence and Grandmother
      Stark shining in her eye. At Point of Rocks, where they had supper and his
      drive ended, her face distracted his heart, and he told her once more
      about his cabin, and lamentably hoped she would remember him. She answered
      sweetly that she would try, and gave him her hand. After all, he was a
      frank-looking boy, who had paid her the highest compliment that a boy (or
      a man for that matter) knows; and it is said that Molly Stark, in her day,
      was not a New Woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new driver banished the first one from the maiden's mind. He was not a
      frank-looking boy, and he had been taking whiskey. All night long he took
      it, while his passenger, helpless and sleepless inside the lurching stage,
      sat as upright as she possibly could; nor did the voices that she heard at
      Drybone reassure her. Sunrise found the white stage lurching eternally on
      across the alkali, with a driver and a bottle on the box, and a pale girl
      staring out at the plain, and knotting in her handkerchief some utterly
      dead flowers. They came to a river where the man bungled over the ford.
      Two wheels sank down over an edge, and the canvas toppled like a
      descending kite. The ripple came sucking through the upper spokes, and as
      she felt the seat careen, she put out her head and tremulously asked if
      anything was wrong. But the driver was addressing his team with much
      language, and also with the lash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a tall rider appeared close against the buried axles, and took her
      out of the stage on his horse so suddenly that she screamed. She felt
      splashes, saw a swimming flood, and found herself lifted down upon the
      shore. The rider said something to her about cheering up, and its being
      all right, but her wits were stock-still, so she did not speak and thank
      him. After four days of train and thirty hours of stage, she was having a
      little too much of the unknown at once. Then the tall man gently withdrew
      leaving her to become herself again. She limply regarded the river pouring
      round the slanted stage, and a number of horsemen with ropes, who righted
      the vehicle, and got it quickly to dry land, and disappeared at once with
      a herd of cattle, uttering lusty yells.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the tall one delaying beside the driver, and speaking. He spoke so
      quietly that not a word reached her, until of a sudden the driver
      protested loudly. The man had thrown something, which turned out to be a
      bottle. This twisted loftily and dived into the stream. He said something
      more to the driver, then put his hand on the saddle-horn, looked
      half-lingeringly at the passenger on the bank, dropped his grave eyes from
      hers, and swinging upon his horse, was gone just as the passenger opened
      her mouth and with inefficient voice murmured, &ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; at his
      departing back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver drove up now, a chastened creature. He helped Miss Wood in, and
      inquired after her welfare with a hanging head; then meek as his own
      drenched horses, he climbed back to his reins, and nursed the stage on
      toward the Bow Leg Mountains much as if it had been a perambulator.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Miss Wood, she sat recovering, and she wondered what the man on the
      horse must think of her. She knew that she was not ungrateful, and that if
      he had given her an opportunity she would have explained to him. If he
      supposed that she did not appreciate his act&mdash;Here into the midst of
      these meditations came an abrupt memory that she had screamed&mdash;she
      could not be sure when. She rehearsed the adventure from the beginning,
      and found one or two further uncertainties&mdash;how it had all been while
      she was on the horse, for instance. It was confusing to determine
      precisely what she had done with her arms. She knew where one of his arms
      had been. And the handkerchief with the flowers was gone. She made a few
      rapid dives in search of it. Had she, or had she not, seen him putting
      something in his pocket? And why had she behaved so unlike herself? In a
      few miles Miss Wood entertained sentiments of maidenly resentment toward
      her rescuer, and of maidenly hope to see him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      To that river crossing he came again, alone, when the days were growing
      short. The ford was dry sand, and the stream a winding lane of shingle. He
      found a pool,&mdash;pools always survive the year round in this stream,&mdash;and
      having watered his pony, he lunched near the spot to which he had borne
      the frightened passenger that day. Where the flowing current had been he
      sat, regarding the now extremely safe channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She cert'nly wouldn't need to grip me so close this mawnin',&rdquo; he said, as
      he pondered over his meal. &ldquo;I reckon it will mightily astonish her when I
      tell her how harmless the torrent is lookin'.&rdquo; He held out to his pony a
      slice of bread matted with sardines, which the pony expertly accepted.
      &ldquo;You're a plumb pie-biter you Monte,&rdquo; he continued. Monte rubbed his nose
      on his master's shoulder. &ldquo;I wouldn't trust you with berries and cream.
      No, seh; not though yu' did rescue a drownin' lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently he tightened the forward cinch, got in the saddle, and the pony
      fell into his wise mechanical jog; for he had come a long way, and was
      going a long way, and he knew this as well as the man did.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use the language of Cattle Land, steers had &ldquo;jumped to seventy-five.&rdquo;
       This was a great and prosperous leap in their value. To have flourished in
      that golden time you need not be dead now, nor even middle-aged; but it is
      Wyoming mythology already&mdash;quite as fabulous as the high-jumping cow.
      Indeed, people gathered together and behaved themselves much in the same
      pleasant and improbable way. Johnson County, and Natrona, and Converse,
      and others, to say nothing of the Cheyenne Club, had been jumping over the
      moon for some weeks, all on account of steers; and on the strength of this
      vigorous price of seventy-five, the Stanton Brothers were giving a
      barbecue at the Goose Egg outfit, their ranch on Bear Creek. Of course the
      whole neighborhood was bidden, and would come forty miles to a man; some
      would come further&mdash;the Virginian was coming a hundred and eighteen.
      It had struck him&mdash;rather suddenly, as shall be made plain&mdash;that
      he should like to see how they were getting along up there on Bear Creek.
      &ldquo;They,&rdquo; was how he put it to his acquaintances. His acquaintances did not
      know that he had bought himself a pair of trousers and a scarf,
      unnecessarily excellent for such a general visit. They did not know that
      in the spring, two days after the adventure with the stage, he had learned
      accidentally who the lady in the stage was. This he had kept to himself;
      nor did the camp ever notice that he had ceased to sing that eightieth
      stanza he had made about the A B C&mdash;the stanza which was not
      printable. He effaced it imperceptibly, giving the boys the other
      seventy-nine at judicious intervals. They dreamed of no guile, but merely
      saw in him, whether frequenting camp or town, the same not over-angelic
      comrade whom they valued and could not wholly understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      All spring he had ridden trail, worked at ditches during summer, and now
      he had just finished with the beef round-up. Yesterday, while he was
      spending a little comfortable money at the Drybone hog-ranch, a casual
      traveller from the north gossiped of Bear Creek, and the fences up there,
      and the farm crops, the Westfalls, and the young schoolmarm from Vermont,
      for whom the Taylors had built a cabin next door to theirs. The traveller
      had not seen her, but Mrs. Taylor and all the ladies thought the world of
      her, and Lin McLean had told him she was &ldquo;away up in G.&rdquo; She would have
      plenty of partners at this Swinton barbecue. Great boon for the country,
      wasn't it, steers jumping that way?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian heard, asking no questions; and left town in an hour, with
      the scarf and trousers tied in his slicker behind his saddle. After
      looking upon the ford again, even though it was dry and not at all the
      same place, he journeyed in attentively. When you have been hard at work
      for months with no time to think, of course you think a great deal during
      your first empty days. &ldquo;Step along, you Monte hawss!&rdquo; he said, rousing
      after some while. He disciplined Monte, who flattened his ears affectedly
      and snorted. &ldquo;Why, you surely ain' thinkin' of you'-self as a hero? She
      wasn't really a-drowndin', you pie-biter.&rdquo; He rested his serious glance
      upon the alkali. &ldquo;She's not likely to have forgot that mix-up, though. I
      guess I'll not remind her about grippin' me, and all that. She wasn't the
      kind a man ought to josh about such things. She had a right clear eye.&rdquo;
       Thus, tall and loose in the saddle, did he jog along the sixty miles which
      still lay between him and the dance.

    <h2>
      X. WHERE FANCY WAS BRED
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two camps in the open, and the Virginian's Monte horse, untired, brought
      him to the Swintons' in good time for the barbecue. The horse received
      good food at length, while his rider was welcomed with good whiskey. GOOD
      whiskey&mdash;for had not steers jumped to seventy-five?
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the Goose Egg kitchen many small delicacies were preparing, and a
      steer was roasting whole outside. The bed of flame under it showed
      steadily brighter against the dusk that was beginning to veil the
      lowlands. The busy hosts went and came, while men stood and men lay near
      the fire-glow. Chalkeye was there, and Nebrasky, and Trampas, and Honey
      Wiggin, with others, enjoying the occasion; but Honey Wiggin was enjoying
      himself: he had an audience; he was sitting up discoursing to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said, perceiving the Virginian. &ldquo;So you've dropped in for your
      turn! Number&mdash;six, ain't he, boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depends who's a-runnin' the countin',&rdquo; said the Virginian, and stretched
      himself down among the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've saw him number one when nobody else was around,&rdquo; said Trampas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far away was you standin' when you beheld that?&rdquo; inquired the
      lounging Southerner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said Wiggin, &ldquo;I expect it will be Miss Schoolmarm says who's
      number one to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she's arrived in this hyeh country?&rdquo; observed the Virginian, very
      casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrived!&rdquo; said Trampas again. &ldquo;Where have you been grazing lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A right smart way from the mules.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nebrasky and the boys was tellin' me they'd missed yu' off the range,&rdquo;
       again interposed Wiggin. &ldquo;Say, Nebrasky, who have yu' offered your canary
      to the schoolmarm said you mustn't give her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nebrasky grinned wretchedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she's a lady, and she's square, not takin' a man's gift when she
      don't take the man. But you'd ought to get back all them letters yu' wrote
      her. Yu' sure ought to ask her for them tell-tales.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, pshaw, Honey!&rdquo; protested the youth. It was well known that he could
      not write his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if here ain't Bokay Baldy!&rdquo; cried the agile Wiggin, stooping to
      fresh prey. &ldquo;Found them slippers yet, Baldy? Tell yu' boys, that was
      turruble sad luck Baldy had. Did yu' hear about that? Baldy, yu' know, he
      can stay on a tame horse most as well as the schoolmarm. But just you give
      him a pair of young knittin'-needles and see him make 'em sweat! He worked
      an elegant pair of slippers with pink cabbages on 'em for Miss Wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bought 'em at Medicine Bow,&rdquo; blundered Baldy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So yu' did!&rdquo; assented the skilful comedian. &ldquo;Baldy he bought 'em. And on
      the road to her cabin there at the Taylors' he got thinkin' they might be
      too big, and he got studyin' what to do. And he fixed up to tell her about
      his not bein' sure of the size, and how she was to let him know if they
      dropped off her, and he'd exchange 'em, and when he got right near her
      door, why, he couldn't find his courage. And so he slips the parcel under
      the fence and starts serenadin' her. But she ain't inside her cabin at
      all. She's at supper next door with the Taylors, and Baldy singin' 'Love
      has conqwered pride and angwer' to a lone house. Lin McLean was comin' up
      by Taylor's corral, where Taylor's Texas bull was. Well, it was turruble
      sad. Baldy's pants got tore, but he fell inside the fence, and Lin druv
      the bull back and somebody stole them Medicine Bow galoshes. Are you goin'
      to knit her some more, Bokay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About half that ain't straight,&rdquo; Baldy commented, with mildness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The half that was tore off yer pants? Well, never mind, Baldy; Lin will
      get left too, same as all of yu'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there many?&rdquo; inquired the Virginian. He was still stretched on his
      back, looking up at the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how many she's been used to where she was raised,&rdquo; Wiggin
      answered. &ldquo;A kid stage-driver come from Point of Rocks one day and went
      back the next. Then the foreman of the 76 outfit, and the horse-wrangler
      from the Bar-Circle-L, and two deputy marshals, with punchers, stringin'
      right along,&mdash;all got their tumble. Old Judge Burrage from Cheyenne
      come up in August for a hunt and stayed round here and never hunted at
      all. There was that horse thief&mdash;awful good-lookin'. Taylor wanted to
      warn her about him, but Mrs. Taylor said she'd look after her if it was
      needed. Mr. Horse-thief gave it up quicker than most; but the schoolmarm
      couldn't have knowed he had a Mrs. Horse-thief camped on Poison Spider
      till afterwards. She wouldn't go ridin' with him. She'll go with some,
      takin' a kid along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Trampas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian stopped looking at the sky, and watched Trampas from where
      he lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she encourages a man some,&rdquo; said poor Nebrasky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Encourages? Because she lets yu' teach her how to shoot,&rdquo; said Wiggin.
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I don't guess I'm a judge. I've always kind o' kep' away from
      them good women. Don't seem to think of anything to chat about to 'em. The
      only folks I'd say she encourages is the school kids. She kisses them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riding and shooting and kissing the kids,&rdquo; sneered Trampas. &ldquo;That's a
      heap too pussy-kitten for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed. The sage-brush audience is readily cynical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look for the man, I say,&rdquo; Trampas pursued. &ldquo;And ain't he there? She
      leaves Baldy sit on the fence while she and Lin McLean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed loudly at the blackguard picture which he drew; and the laugh
      stopped short, for the Virginian stood over Trampas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can rise up now, and tell them you lie,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was still for a moment in the dead silence. &ldquo;I thought you claimed
      you and her wasn't acquainted,&rdquo; said he then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand on your laigs, you polecat, and say you're a liar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trampas's hand moved behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit that,&rdquo; said the Southerner, &ldquo;or I'll break your neck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eye of a man is the prince of deadly weapons. Trampas looked in the
      Virginian's, and slowly rose. &ldquo;I didn't mean&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and paused,
      his face poisonously bloated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll call that sufficient. Keep a-standin' still. I ain' going to
      trouble yu' long. In admittin' yourself to be a liar you have spoke God's
      truth for onced. Honey Wiggin, you and me and the boys have hit town too
      frequent for any of us to play Sunday on the balance of the gang.&rdquo; He
      stopped and surveyed Public Opinion, seated around in carefully
      inexpressive attention. &ldquo;We ain't a Christian outfit a little bit, and
      maybe we have most forgotten what decency feels like. But I reckon we
      haven't forgot what it means. You can sit down now, if you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The liar stood and sneered experimentally, looking at Public Opinion. But
      this changeful deity was no longer with him, and he heard it variously
      assenting, &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; and &ldquo;She's a lady,&rdquo; and otherwise excellently
      moralizing. So he held his peace. When, however, the Virginian had
      departed to the roasting steer, and Public Opinion relaxed into that
      comfort which we all experience when the sermon ends, Trampas sat down
      amid the reviving cheerfulness, and ventured again to be facetious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut your rank mouth,&rdquo; said Wiggin to him, amiably. &ldquo;I don't care whether
      he knows her or if he done it on principle. I'll accept the roundin' up he
      gave us&mdash;and say! You'll swallo' your dose, too! Us boys'll stand in
      with him in this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Trampas swallowed. And what of the Virginian?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had championed the feeble, and spoken honorably in meeting, and
      according to all the constitutions and by-laws of morality, he should have
      been walking in virtue's especial calm. But there it was! he had spoken;
      he had given them a peep through the key-hole at his inner man; and as he
      prowled away from the assemblage before whom he stood convicted of
      decency, it was vicious rather than virtuous that he felt. Other matters
      also disquieted him&mdash;so Lin McLean was hanging round that schoolmarm!
      Yet he joined Ben Swinton in a seemingly Christian spirit. He took some
      whiskey and praised the size of the barrel, speaking with his host like
      this: &ldquo;There cert'nly ain' goin' to be trouble about a second helpin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope not. We'd ought to have more trimmings, though. We're shy on ducks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yu' have the barrel. Has Lin McLean seen that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We tried for ducks away down as far as the Laparel outfit. A real
      barbecue&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's large thirsts on Bear Creek. Lin McLean will pass on ducks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lin's not thirsty this month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signed for one month, has he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signed! He's spooning our schoolmarm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They claim she's a right sweet-faced girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; yes; awful agreeable. And next thing you're fooled clean through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yu' don't say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She keeps a-teaching the darned kids, and it seems like a good growed-up
      man can't interest her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YU' DON'T SAY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There used to be all the ducks you wanted at the Laparel, but their fool
      cook's dead stuck on raising turkeys this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must have been mighty close to a drowndin' the schoolmarm got at
      South Fork.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I guess not. When? She's never spoken of any such thing&mdash;that
      I've heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mos' likely the stage-driver got it wrong, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Must have drownded somebody else. Here they come! That's her ridin'
      the horse. There's the Westfalls. Where are you running to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To fix up. Got any soap around hyeh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; shouted Swinton, for the Virginian was now some distance away;
      &ldquo;towels and everything in the dugout.&rdquo; And he went to welcome his first
      formal guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian reached his saddle under a shed. &ldquo;So she's never mentioned
      it,&rdquo; said he, untying his slicker for the trousers and scarf. &ldquo;I didn't
      notice Lin anywheres around her.&rdquo; He was over in the dugout now, whipping
      off his overalls; and soon he was excellently clean and ready, except for
      the tie in his scarf and the part in his hair. &ldquo;I'd have knowed her in
      Greenland,&rdquo; he remarked. He held the candle up and down at the
      looking-glass, and the looking-glass up and down at his head. &ldquo;It's mighty
      strange why she ain't mentioned that.&rdquo; He worried the scarf a fold or two
      further, and at length, a trifle more than satisfied with his appearance,
      he proceeded most serenely toward the sound of the tuning fiddles. He
      passed through the store-room behind the kitchen, stepping lightly lest he
      should rouse the ten or twelve babies that lay on the table or beneath it.
      On Bear Creek babies and children always went with their parents to a
      dance, because nurses were unknown. So little Alfred and Christopher lay
      there among the wraps, parallel and crosswise with little Taylors, and
      little Carmodys, and Lees, and all the Bear Creek offspring that was not
      yet able to skip at large and hamper its indulgent elders in the
      ball-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Lin ain't hyeh yet!&rdquo; said the Virginian, looking in upon the people.
      There was Miss Wood, standing up for the quadrille. &ldquo;I didn't remember her
      hair was that pretty,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But ain't she a little, little girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now she was in truth five feet three; but then he could look away down on
      the top of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salute your honey!&rdquo; called the first fiddler. All partners bowed to each
      other, and as she turned, Miss Wood saw the man in the doorway. Again, as
      it had been at South Fork that day, his eyes dropped from hers, and she
      divining instantly why he had come after half a year, thought of the
      handkerchief and of that scream of hers in the river, and became filled
      with tyranny and anticipation; for indeed he was fine to look upon. So she
      danced away, carefully unaware of his existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First lady, centre!&rdquo; said her partner, reminding her of her turn. &ldquo;Have
      you forgotten how it goes since last time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly Wood did not forget again, but quadrilled with the most sprightly
      devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see some new faces to-night,&rdquo; said she, presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yu' always do forget our poor faces,&rdquo; said her partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! There's a stranger now. Who is that black man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;he's from Virginia, and he ain't allowin' he's black.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a tenderfoot, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha! That's rich, too!&rdquo; and so the simple partner explained a
      great deal about the Virginian to Molly Wood. At the end of the set she
      saw the man by the door take a step in her direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she, quickly, to the partner, &ldquo;how warm it is! I must see how
      those babies are doing.&rdquo; And she passed the Virginian in a breeze of
      unconcern.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes gravely lingered where she had gone. &ldquo;She knowed me right away,&rdquo;
       said he. He looked for a moment, then leaned against the door. &ldquo;'How warm
      it is!' said she. Well, it ain't so screechin' hot hyeh; and as for
      rushin' after Alfred and Christopher, when their natural motheh is bumpin'
      around handy&mdash;she cert'nly can't be offended?&rdquo; he broke off, and
      looked again where she had gone. And then Miss Wood passed him brightly
      again, and was dancing the schottische almost immediately. &ldquo;Oh, yes, she
      knows me,&rdquo; the swarthy cow-puncher mused. &ldquo;She has to take trouble not to
      see me. And what she's a-fussin' at is mighty interestin'. Hello!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; returned Lin McLean, sourly. He had just looked into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not dancin'?&rdquo; the Southerner inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had scyarlet fever and forgot your past life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lin grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better persuade the schoolmarm to learn it. She's goin' to give me
      instruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; went Mr. McLean, and skulked out to the barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they claimed you weren't drinkin' this month!&rdquo; said his friend,
      following.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am. Here's luck!&rdquo; The two pledged in tin cups. &ldquo;But I'm not
      waltzin' with her,&rdquo; blurted Mr. McLean grievously. &ldquo;She called me an
      exception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waltzin',&rdquo; repeated the Virginian quickly, and hearing the fiddles he
      hastened away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few in the Bear Creek Country could waltz, and with these few it was
      mostly an unsteered and ponderous exhibition; therefore was the Southerner
      bent upon profiting by his skill. He entered the room, and his lady saw
      him come where she sat alone for the moment, and her thoughts grew a
      little hurried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you try a turn, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo; It was a remote, well-schooled eye that she lifted
      now upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like a waltz, ma'am, will you waltz with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're from Virginia, I understand?&rdquo; said Molly Wood, regarding him
      politely, but not rising. One gains authority immensely by keeping one's
      seat. All good teachers know this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am, from Virginia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard that Southerners have such good manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's correct.&rdquo; The cow-puncher flushed, but he spoke in his unvaryingly
      gentle voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For in New England, you know,&rdquo; pursued Miss Molly, noting his scarf and
      clean-shaven chin, and then again steadily meeting his eye, &ldquo;gentlemen ask
      to be presented to ladies before they ask them to waltz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood a moment before her, deeper and deeper scarlet; and the more she
      saw his handsome face, the keener rose her excitement. She waited for him
      to speak of the river; for then she was going to be surprised, and
      gradually to remember, and finally to be very nice to him. But he did not
      wait. &ldquo;I ask your pardon, lady,&rdquo; said he, and bowing, walked off, leaving
      her at once afraid that he might not come back. But she had altogether
      mistaken her man. Back he came serenely with Mr. Taylor, and was duly
      presented to her. Thus were the conventions vindicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can never be known what the cow-puncher was going to say next; for
      Uncle Hughey stepped up with a glass of water which he had left Wood to
      bring, and asking for a turn, most graciously received it. She danced away
      from a situation where she began to feel herself getting the worst of it.
      One moment the Virginian stared at his lady as she lightly circulated, and
      then he went out to the barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leave him for Uncle Hershey! Jealousy is a deep and delicate thing, and
      works its spite in many ways. The Virginian had been ready to look at Lin
      McLean with a hostile eye; but finding him now beside the barrel, he felt
      a brotherhood between himself and Lin, and his hostility had taken a new
      and whimsical direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's how!&rdquo; said he to McLean. And they pledged each other in the tin
      cups.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been gettin' them instructions?&rdquo; said Mr. McLean, grinning. &ldquo;I thought I
      saw yu' learning your steps through the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's your good health,&rdquo; said the Southerner. Once more they pledged
      each other handsomely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she call you an exception, or anything?&rdquo; said Lin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it would cipher out right close in that neighborhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's how, then!&rdquo; cried the delighted Lin, over his cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest because yu' happen to come from Vermont,&rdquo; continued Mr. McLean, &ldquo;is
      no cause for extra pride. Shoo! I was raised in Massachusetts myself, and
      big men have been raised there, too,&mdash;Daniel Webster and Israel
      Putnam: and a lot of them politicians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Virginia is a good little old state,&rdquo; observed the Southerner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of 'em's a sight ahead of Vermont. She told me I was the first
      exception she'd struck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rule were you provin' at the time, Lin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well yu' see, I started to kiss her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yu' didn't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks! I didn't mean nothin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon yu' stopped mighty sudden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I'd been ridin' out with her&mdash;ridin' to school, ridin' from
      school, and a-comin' and a-goin', and she chattin' cheerful and askin' me
      a heap o' questions all about myself every day, and I not lyin' much
      neither. And so I figured she wouldn't mind. Lots of 'em like it. But she
      didn't, you bet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Virginian, deeply proud of his lady who had slighted him.
      He had pulled her out of the water once, and he had been her unrewarded
      knight even to-day, and he felt his grievance; but he spoke not of it to
      Lin; for he felt also, in memory, her arms clinging round him as he
      carried her ashore upon his horse. But he muttered, &ldquo;Plumb ridiculous!&rdquo; as
      her injustice struck him afresh, while the outraged McLean told his tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trample is what she has done on me to-night, and without notice. We was
      startin' to come here; Taylor and Mrs. were ahead in the buggy, and I was
      holdin' her horse, and helpin' her up in the saddle, like I done for days
      and days. Who was there to see us? And I figured she'd not mind, and she
      calls me an exception! Yu'd ought to've just heard her about Western men
      respectin' women. So that's the last word we've spoke. We come twenty-five
      miles then, she scootin' in front, and her horse kickin' the sand in my
      face. Mrs. Taylor, she guessed something was up, but she didn't tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Wood did not tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not she! She'll never open her head. She can take care of herself, you
      bet!&rdquo; The fiddles sounded hilariously in the house, and the feet also.
      They had warmed up altogether, and their dancing figures crossed the
      windows back and forth. The two cow-punchers drew near to a window and
      looked in gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she goes,&rdquo; said Lin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Uncle Hughey again,&rdquo; said the Virginian, sourly. &ldquo;Yu' might suppose
      he didn't have a wife and twins, to see the way he goes gambollin'
      around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Westfall is takin' a turn with her now,&rdquo; said McLean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James!&rdquo; exclaimed the Virginian. &ldquo;He's another with a wife and fam'ly,
      and he gets the dancin', too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she goes with Taylor,&rdquo; said Lin, presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another married man!&rdquo; the Southerner commented. They prowled round to the
      store-room, and passed through the kitchen to where the dancers were
      robustly tramping. Miss Wood was still the partner of Mr. Taylor. &ldquo;Let's
      have some whiskey,&rdquo; said the Virginian. They had it, and returned, and the
      Virginian's disgust and sense of injury grew deeper. &ldquo;Old Carmody has got
      her now,&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;He polkas like a landslide. She learns his
      monkey-faced kid to spell dog and cow all the mawnin'. He'd ought to be
      tucked up cosey in his bed right now, old Carmody ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were standing in that place set apart for the sleeping children; and
      just at this moment one of two babies that were stowed beneath a chair
      uttered a drowsy note. A much louder cry, indeed a chorus of lament, would
      have been needed to reach the ears of the parents in the room beyond, such
      was the noisy volume of the dance. But in this quiet place the light sound
      caught Mr. McLean's attention, and he turned to see if anything were
      wrong. But both babies were sleeping peacefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them's Uncle Hughey's twins,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you happen to know that?&rdquo; inquired the Virginian, suddenly
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw his wife put 'em under the chair so she could find 'em right off when
      she come to go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Virginian, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Oh, find 'em right off. Yes.
      Uncle Hughey's twins.&rdquo; He walked to a spot from which he could view the
      dance. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued, returning, &ldquo;the schoolmarm must have taken
      quite a notion to Uncle Hughey. He has got her for this quadrille.&rdquo; The
      Virginian was now speaking without rancor; but his words came with a
      slightly augmented drawl, and this with him was often a bad omen. He now
      turned his eyes upon the collected babies wrapped in various colored
      shawls and knitted work. &ldquo;Nine, ten, eleven, beautiful sleepin'
      strangers,&rdquo; he counted, in a sweet voice. &ldquo;Any of 'em your'n, Lin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; grinned Mr. McLean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eleven, twelve. This hyeh is little Christopher in the blue-stripe quilt&mdash;or
      maybe that other yello'-head is him. The angels have commenced to drop in
      on us right smart along Bear Creek, Lin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What trash are yu' talkin' anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they look so awful alike in the heavenly gyarden,&rdquo; the gentle
      Southerner continued, &ldquo;I'd just hate to be the folks that has the cuttin'
      of 'em out o' the general herd. And that's a right quaint notion too,&rdquo; he
      added softly. &ldquo;Them under the chair are Uncle Hughey's, didn't you tell
      me?&rdquo; And stooping, he lifted the torpid babies and placed them beneath a
      table. &ldquo;No, that ain't thorough,&rdquo; he murmured. With wonderful dexterity
      and solicitude for their wellfare, he removed the loose wrap which was
      around them, and this soon led to an intricate process of exchange. For a
      moment Mr. McLean had been staring at the Virginian, puzzled. Then, with a
      joyful yelp of enlightenment, he sprang to abet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while both busied themselves with the shawls and quilts, the
      unconscious parents went dancing vigorously on, and the small, occasional
      cries of their progeny did not reach them.

    <h2>
      XI. &ldquo;YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME BEFORE WE GET THROUGH&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      The Swinton barbecue was over. The fiddles were silent, the steer was
      eaten, the barrel emptied, or largely so, and the tapers extinguished;
      round the house and sunken fire all movement of guests was quiet; the
      families were long departed homeward, and after their hospitable
      turbulence, the Swintons slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Westfall drove through the night, and as they neared their
      cabin there came from among the bundled wraps a still, small voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;I said Alfred would catch cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh! Lizzie, don't you fret. He's a little more than a yearlin', and of
      course he'll snuffle.&rdquo; And young James took a kiss from his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how you can speak of Alfred that way, calling him a yearling, as if
      he was a calf, and he just as much your child as mine, I don't see, James
      Westfall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what under the sun do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he goes again! Do hurry up home, Jim. He's got a real strange
      cough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they hurried home. Soon the nine miles were finished, and good James
      was unhitching by his stable lantern, while his wife in the house hastened
      to commit their offspring to bed. The traces had dropped, and each horse
      marched forward for further unbuckling, when James heard himself called.
      Indeed, there was that in his wife's voice which made him jerk out his
      pistol as he ran. But it was no bear or Indian&mdash;only two strange
      children on the bed. His wife was glaring at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed with relief and laid down the pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put that on again, James Westfall. You'll need it. Look here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they won't bite. Whose are they? Where have you stowed ourn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have I&mdash;&rdquo; Utterance forsook this mother for a moment. &ldquo;And you
      ask me!&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Ask Lin McLean. Ask him that sets bulls on folks
      and steals slippers, what he's done with our innocent lambs, mixing them
      up with other people's coughing, unhealthy brats. That's Charlie Taylor in
      Alfred's clothes, and I know Alfred didn't cough like that, and I said to
      you it was strange; and the other one that's been put in Christopher's new
      quilts is not even a bub&mdash;bub&mdash;boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As this crime against society loomed clear to James Westfall's
      understanding, he sat down on the nearest piece of furniture, and heedless
      of his wife's tears and his exchanged children, broke into unregenerate
      laughter. Doubtless after his sharp alarm about the bear, he was unstrung.
      His lady, however, promptly restrung him; and by the time they had
      repacked the now clamorous changelings, and were rattling on their way to
      the Taylors', he began to share her outraged feelings properly, as a
      husband and a father should; but when he reached the Taylors' and learned
      from Miss Wood that at this house a child had been unwrapped whom nobody
      could at all identify, and that Mr. and Mrs. Taylor were already far on
      the road to the Swintons', James Westfall whipped up his horses and grew
      almost as thirsty for revenge as was his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the steer had been roasted, the powdered ashes were now cold white,
      and Mr. McLean, feeling through his dreams the change of dawn come over
      the air, sat up cautiously among the outdoor slumberers and waked his
      neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Day will be soon,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;and we must light out of this. I never
      suspicioned yu' had that much of the devil in you before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon some of the fellows will act haidstrong,&rdquo; the Virginian murmured
      luxuriously, among the warmth of his blankets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell yu' we must skip,&rdquo; said Lin, for the second time; and he rubbed
      the Virginian's black head, which alone was visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skip, then, you,&rdquo; came muffled from within, &ldquo;and keep you'self mighty
      sca'ce till they can appreciate our frolic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Southerner withdrew deeper into his bed, and Mr. McLean, informing him
      that he was a fool, arose and saddled his horse. From the saddle-bag, he
      brought a parcel, and lightly laying this beside Bokay Baldy, he mounted
      and was gone. When Baldy awoke later, he found the parcel to be a pair of
      flowery slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In selecting the inert Virginian as the fool, Mr. McLean was scarcely
      wise; it is the absent who are always guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before ever Lin could have been a mile in retreat, the rattle of the
      wheels roused all of them, and here came the Taylors. Before the Taylors'
      knocking had brought the Swintons to their door, other wheels sounded, and
      here were Mr. and Mrs. Carmody, and Uncle Hughey with his wife, and close
      after them Mr. Dow, alone, who told how his wife had gone into one of her
      fits&mdash;she upon whom Dr. Barker at Drybone had enjoined total
      abstinence from all excitement. Voices of women and children began to be
      uplifted; the Westfalls arrived in a lather, and the Thomases; and by
      sunrise, what with fathers and mothers and spectators and loud offspring,
      there was gathered such a meeting as has seldom been before among the
      generations of speaking men. To-day you can hear legends of it from Texas
      to Montana; but I am giving you the full particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course they pitched upon poor Lin. Here was the Virginian doing his
      best, holding horses and helping ladies descend, while the name of McLean
      began to be muttered with threats. Soon a party led by Mr. Dow set forth
      in search of him, and the Southerner debated a moment if he had better not
      put them on a wrong track. But he concluded that they might safely go on
      searching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westfall found Christopher at once in the green shawl of Anna Maria
      Dow, but all was not achieved thus in the twinkling of an eye. Mr. McLean
      had, it appeared, as James Westfall lugubriously pointed out, not merely
      &ldquo;swapped the duds; he had shuffled the whole doggone deck;&rdquo; and they
      cursed this Satanic invention. The fathers were but of moderate
      assistance; it was the mothers who did the heavy work; and by ten o'clock
      some unsolved problems grew so delicate that a ladies' caucus was
      organized in a private room,&mdash;no admittance for men,&mdash;and what
      was done there I can only surmise.
    </p>
    <p>
      During its progress the search party returned. It had not found Mr.
      McLean. It had found a tree with a notice pegged upon it, reading, &ldquo;God
      bless our home!&rdquo; This was captured.
    </p>
    <p>
      But success attended the caucus; each mother emerged, satisfied that she
      had received her own, and each sire, now that his family was itself again,
      began to look at his neighbor sideways. After a man has been angry enough
      to kill another man, after the fire of righteous slaughter has raged in
      his heart as it had certainly raged for several hours in the hearts of
      these fathers, the flame will usually burn itself out. This will be so in
      a generous nature, unless the cause of the anger is still unchanged. But
      the children had been identified; none had taken hurt. All had been
      humanely given their nourishment. The thing was over. The day was
      beautiful. A tempting feast remained from the barbecue. These Bear Creek
      fathers could not keep their ire at red heat. Most of them, being as yet
      more their wives' lovers than their children's parents, began to see the
      mirthful side of the adventure; and they ceased to feel very severely
      toward Lin McLean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so the women. They cried for vengeance; but they cried in vain, and
      were met with smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westfall argued long that punishment should be dealt the offender.
      &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she persisted, &ldquo;it was real defiant of him putting that up on
      the tree. I might forgive him but for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; spoke the Virginian in their midst, &ldquo;that wasn't sort o' right.
      Especially as I am the man you're huntin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat dumb at his assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and kill me,&rdquo; he continued, round upon the party. &ldquo;I'll not resist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they could not resist the way in which he had looked round upon them.
      He had chosen the right moment for his confession, as a captain of a horse
      awaits the proper time for a charge. Some rebukes he did receive; the
      worst came from the mothers. And all that he could say for himself was, &ldquo;I
      am getting off too easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what was your point?&rdquo; said Westfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blamed if I know any more. I expect it must have been the whiskey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would mind it less,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westfall, &ldquo;if you looked a bit sorry or
      ashamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian shook his head at her penitently. &ldquo;I'm tryin' to,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus he sat disarming his accusers until they began to lunch upon the
      copious remnants of the barbecue. He did not join them at this meal. In
      telling you that Mrs. Dow was the only lady absent upon this historic
      morning, I was guilty of an inadvertence. There was one other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian rode away sedately through the autumn sunshine; and as he
      went he asked his Monte horse a question. &ldquo;Do yu' reckon she'll have
      forgotten you too, you pie-biter?&rdquo; said he. Instead of the new trousers,
      the cow-puncher's leathern chaps were on his legs. But he had the new
      scarf knotted at his neck. Most men would gladly have equalled him in
      appearance. &ldquo;You Monte,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will she be at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Sunday, and no school day, and he found her in her cabin that stood
      next the Taylors' house. Her eyes were very bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd thought I'd just call,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's such a pity! Mr. and Mrs. Taylor are away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; they've been right busy. That's why I thought I'd call. Will yu'
      come for a ride, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can ride my hawss. He's gentle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! And you walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am. Nor the two of us ride him THIS time, either.&rdquo; At this she
      turned entirely pink, and he, noticing, went on quietly: &ldquo;I'll catch up
      one of Taylor's hawsses. Taylor knows me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I don't really think I could do that. But thank you. Thank you very
      much. I must go now and see how Mrs. Taylor's fire is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll look after that, ma'am. I'd like for yu' to go ridin' mighty well.
      Yu' have no babies this mawnin' to be anxious after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this shaft, Grandmother Stark flashed awake deep within the spirit of
      her descendant, and she made a haughty declaration of war. &ldquo;I don't know
      what you mean, sir,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now was his danger; for it was easy to fall into mere crude impertinence
      and ask her why, then, did she speak thus abruptly? There were various
      easy things of this kind for him to say. And any rudeness would have lost
      him the battle. But the Virginian was not the man to lose such a battle in
      such a way. His shaft had hit. She thought he referred to those babies
      about whom last night she had shown such superfluous solicitude. Her
      conscience was guilty. This was all that he had wished to make sure of
      before he began operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I mean,&rdquo; said he, easily, sitting down near the door, &ldquo;that it's
      Sunday. School don't hinder yu' from enjoyin' a ride to-day. You'll teach
      the kids all the better for it to-morro', ma'am. Maybe it's your duty.&rdquo;
       And he smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My duty! It's quite novel to have strangers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I a stranger?&rdquo; he cut in, firing his first broadside. &ldquo;I was
      introduced, ma'am,&rdquo; he continued, noting how she had flushed again. &ldquo;And I
      would not be oversteppin' for the world. I'll go away if yu' want.&rdquo; And
      hereupon he quietly rose, and stood, hat in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly was flustered. She did not at all want him to go. No one of her
      admirers had ever been like this creature. The fringed leathern
      chaparreros, the cartridge belt, the flannel shirt, the knotted scarf at
      the neck, these things were now an old story to her. Since her arrival she
      had seen young men and old in plenty dressed thus. But worn by this man
      now standing by her door, they seemed to radiate romance. She did not want
      him to go&mdash;and she wished to win her battle. And now in her agitation
      she became suddenly severe, as she had done at Hoosic Junction. He should
      have a punishment to remember!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You call yourself a man, I suppose,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not tremble in the least. Her fierceness filled him with
      delight, and the tender desire of ownership flooded through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A grown-up, responsible man,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am. I think so.&rdquo; He now sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you let them think that&mdash;that Mr. McLean&mdash;You dare not look
      me in the face and say that Mr. McLean did that last night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I dassent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! I knew it! I said so from the first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And me a stranger to you!&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his second broadside. It left her badly crippled. She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did yu' mention it to, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hoped she had him. &ldquo;Why, are you afraid?&rdquo; And she laughed lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told 'em myself. And their astonishment seemed so genu-wine I'd just
      hate to think they had fooled me that thorough when they knowed it all
      along from you seeing me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not see you. I knew it must&mdash;of course I did not tell any one.
      When I said I said so from the first, I meant&mdash;you can understand
      perfectly what I meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Molly was near stamping her foot. &ldquo;And what sort of a trick,&rdquo; she
      rushed on, &ldquo;was that to play? Do you call it a manly thing to frighten and
      distress women because you&mdash;for no reason at all? I should never have
      imagined it could be the act of a person who wears a big pistol and rides
      a big horse. I should be afraid to go riding with such an immature
      protector.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that was awful childish. Your words do cut a little; for maybe
      there's been times when I have acted pretty near like a man. But I
      cert'nly forgot to be introduced before I spoke to yu' last night. Because
      why? You've found me out dead in one thing. Won't you take a guess at this
      too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot sit guessing why people do not behave themselves&mdash;who seem
      to know better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma'am, I've played square and owned up to yu'. And that's not what
      you're doin' by me. I ask your pardon if I say what I have a right to say
      in language not as good as I'd like to talk to yu' with. But at South Fork
      Crossin' who did any introducin'? Did yu' complain I was a stranger then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;no!&rdquo; she flashed out; then, quite sweetly, &ldquo;The driver told me it
      wasn't REALLY so dangerous there, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not the point I'm makin'. You are a grown-up woman, a responsible
      woman. You've come ever so far, and all alone, to a rough country to
      instruct young children that play games,&mdash;tag, and hide-and-seek, and
      fooleries they'll have to quit when they get old. Don't you think
      pretendin' yu' don't know a man,&mdash;his name's nothin', but him,&mdash;a
      man whom you were glad enough to let assist yu' when somebody was needed,&mdash;don't
      you think that's mighty close to hide-and-seek them children plays? I
      ain't so sure but what there's a pair of us children in this hyeh room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly Wood was regarding him saucily. &ldquo;I don't think I like you,&rdquo; said
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all square enough. You're goin' to love me before we get through.
      I wish yu'd come a-ridin, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear, dear! So I'm going to love you? How will you do it? I know
      men think that they only need to sit and look strong and make chests at a
      girl&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness gracious! I ain't makin' any chests at yu'!&rdquo; Laughter overcame
      him for a moment, and Miss Wood liked his laugh very much. &ldquo;Please come
      a-ridin',&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;It's the prettiest kind of a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him frankly, and there was a pause. &ldquo;I will take back two
      things that I said to you,&rdquo; she then answered him. &ldquo;I believe that I do
      like you. And I know that if I went riding with you, I should not have an
      immature protector.&rdquo; And then, with a final gesture of acknowledgment, she
      held out her hand to him. &ldquo;And I have always wanted,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to thank
      you for what you did at the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand, and his heart bounded. &ldquo;You're a gentleman!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now her turn to be overcome with merriment. &ldquo;I've always wanted to
      be a man,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am mighty glad you ain't,&rdquo; said he, looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Molly had already received enough broadsides for one day. She could
      allow no more of them, and she took herself capably in hand. &ldquo;Where did
      you learn to make such pretty speeches?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Well, never mind
      that. One sees that you have had plenty of practice for one so young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am twenty-seven,&rdquo; blurted the Virginian, and knew instantly that he had
      spoken like a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would have dreamed it!&rdquo; said Molly, with well-measured mockery. She
      knew that she had scored at last, and that this day was hers. &ldquo;Don't be
      too sure you are glad I'm not a man,&rdquo; she now told him. There was
      something like a challenge in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I risk it,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For I am almost twenty-three myself,&rdquo; she concluded. And she gave him a
      look on her own account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you'll not come a-ridin'?&rdquo; he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered him; &ldquo;no.&rdquo; And he knew that he could not make her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will tell yu' good-by,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But I am comin' again. And next
      time I'll have along a gentle hawss for yu'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next time! Next time! Well, perhaps I will go with you. Do you live far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I live on Judge Henry's ranch, over yondeh.&rdquo; He pointed across the
      mountains. &ldquo;It's on Sunk Creek. A pretty rough trail; but I can come hyeh
      to see you in a day, I reckon. Well, I hope you'll cert'nly enjoy good
      health, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there's one thing!&rdquo; said Molly Wood, calling after him rather
      quickly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I'm not at all afraid of horses. You needn't bring such
      a gentle one. I&mdash;was very tired that day, and&mdash;and I don't
      scream as a rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and looked at her so that she could not meet his glance. &ldquo;Bless
      your heart!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Will yu' give me one o' those flowers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly! I'm always so glad when people like them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're pretty near the color of your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind my eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't help it, ma'am. Not since South Fork.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put the flower in the leather band of his hat, and rode away on his
      Monte horse. Miss Wood lingered a moment, then made some steps toward her
      gate, from which he could still be seen; and then, with something like a
      toss of the head, she went in and shut her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the day the Virginian met Mr. McLean, who looked at his hat and
      innocently quoted, &ldquo;'My Looloo picked a daisy.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't yu', Lin,&rdquo; said the Southerner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I won't,&rdquo; said Lin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, for this occasion, did the Virginian part from his lady&mdash;and
      nothing said one way or another about the handkerchief that had
      disappeared during the South Fork incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we fall asleep at night, our thoughts will often ramble back and forth
      between the two worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What color were his eyes?&rdquo; wondered Molly on her pillow. &ldquo;His mustache is
      not bristly like so many of them. Sam never gave me such a look at Hoosic
      Junction. No.... You can't come with me.... Get off your horse.... The
      passengers are all staring....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while Molly was thus dreaming that the Virginian had ridden his horse
      into the railroad car, and sat down beside her, the fire in the great
      stone chimney of her cabin flickered quietly, its gleams now and again
      touching the miniature of Grandmother Stark upon the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camped on the Sunk Creek trail, the Virginian was telling himself in his
      blankets: &ldquo;I ain't too old for education. Maybe she will lend me books.
      And I'll watch her ways and learn...stand still, Monte. I can learn a lot
      more than the kids on that. There's Monte...you pie-biter, stop.... He has
      ate up your book, ma'am, but I'll get yu'...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then the Virginian was fast asleep.

      XII. QUALITY AND EQUALITY
    </h2>
    <p>
      To the circle at Bennington, a letter from Bear Creek was always a welcome
      summons to gather and hear of doings very strange to Vermont. And when the
      tale of the changed babies arrived duly by the post, it created a more
      than usual sensation, and was read to a large number of pleased and
      scandalized neighbors. &ldquo;I hate her to be where such things can happen,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could have been there,&rdquo; said her son-in-law, Andrew Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not mention who played the trick,&rdquo; said Mrs. Andrew Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shouldn't be any wiser if she did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to meet the perpetrator,&rdquo; said Andrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Mrs. Wood. &ldquo;They're all horrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she wrote at once, begging her daughter to take good care of herself,
      and to see as much of Mrs. Balaam as possible. &ldquo;And of any other ladies
      that are near you. For you seem to me to be in a community of roughs. I
      wish you would give it all up. Did you expect me to laugh about the
      babies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Flynt, when this story was repeated to her (she had not been invited
      in to hear the letter), remarked that she had always felt that Molly Wood
      must be a little vulgar, ever since she began to go about giving music
      lessons like any ordinary German.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Wood was considerably relieved when the next letter arrived. It
      contained nothing horrible about barbecues or babies. It mentioned the
      great beauty of the weather, and how well and strong the fine air was
      making the writer feel. And it asked that books might be sent, many books
      of all sorts, novels, poetry, all the good old books and any good new ones
      that could be spared. Cheap editions, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed she shall have them!&rdquo; said Mrs. Wood. &ldquo;How her mind must be
      starving in that dreadful place!&rdquo; The letter was not a long one, and,
      besides the books, spoke of little else except the fine weather and the
      chances for outdoor exercise that this gave. &ldquo;You have no idea,&rdquo; it said,
      &ldquo;how delightful it is to ride, especially on a spirited horse, which I can
      do now quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice that is!&rdquo; said Mrs. Wood, putting down the letter. &ldquo;I hope the
      horse is not too spirited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who does she go riding with?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't say, Sarah. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. She has a queer way of not mentioning things, now and then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarah!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Wood, reproachfully. &ldquo;Oh, well, mother, you know
      just as well as I do that she can be very independent and unconventional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but not in that way. She wouldn't ride with poor Sam Bannett, and
      after all he is a suitable person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, in her next letter, Mrs. Wood cautioned her daughter about
      trusting herself with any one of whom Mrs. Balaam did not thoroughly
      approve. The good lady could never grasp that Mrs. Balaam lived a long
      day's journey from Bear Creek, and that Molly saw her about once every
      three months. &ldquo;We have sent your books,&rdquo; the mother wrote; &ldquo;everybody has
      contributed from their store,&mdash;Shakespeare, Tennyson, Browning,
      Longfellow; and a number of novels by Scott, Thackeray, George Eliot,
      Hawthorne, and lesser writers; some volumes of Emerson; and Jane Austen
      complete, because you admire her so particularly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This consignment of literature reached Bear Creek about a week before
      Christmas time.
    </p>
    <p>
      By New Year's Day, the Virginian had begun his education.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have managed to get through 'em,&rdquo; he said, as he entered Molly's
      cabin in February. And he laid two volumes upon her table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think of them?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that I've cert'nly earned a good long ride to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Georgie Taylor has sprained his ankle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't mean that kind of a ride. I've earned a ride with just us two
      alone. I've read every word of both of 'em, yu' know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll think about it. Did you like them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not much. If I'd knowed that one was a detective story, I'd have got
      yu' to try something else on me. Can you guess the murderer, or is the
      author too smart for yu'? That's all they amount to. Well, he was too
      smart for me this time, but that didn't distress me any. That other book
      talks too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly was scandalized, and she told him it was a great work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, yes. A fine book. But it will keep up its talkin'. Don't let you
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you feel sorry for poor Maggie Tulliver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hmp. Yes. Sorry for her, and for Tawmmy, too. But the man did right to
      drownd 'em both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't a man. A woman wrote that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman did! Well, then, o' course she talks too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not go riding with you!&rdquo; shrieked Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did. And he returned to Sunk Creek, not with a detective story,
      but this time with a Russian novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost April when he brought it back to her&mdash;and a heavy sleet
      storm lost them their ride. So he spent his time indoors with her, not
      speaking a syllable of love. When he came to take his departure, he asked
      her for some other book by this same Russian. But she had no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I've never saw a book could tell the truth
      like that one does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you like about it?&rdquo; she exclaimed. To her it had been
      distasteful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;That young come-outer, and his fam'ly that
      can't understand him&mdash;for he is broad gauge, yu' see, and they are
      narro' gauge.&rdquo; The Virginian looked at Molly a moment almost shyly. &ldquo;Do
      you know,&rdquo; he said, and a blush spread over his face, &ldquo;I pretty near cried
      when that young come-outer was dyin', and said about himself, 'I was a
      giant.' Life made him broad gauge, yu' see, and then took his chance
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly liked the Virginian for his blush. It made him very handsome. But
      she thought that it came from his confession about &ldquo;pretty near crying.&rdquo;
       The deeper cause she failed to divine,&mdash;that he, like the dying hero
      in the novel, felt himself to be a giant whom life had made &ldquo;broad gauge,&rdquo;
       and denied opportunity. Fecund nature begets and squanders thousands of
      these rich seeds in the wilderness of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took away with him a volume of Shakespeare. &ldquo;I've saw good plays of
      his,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kind Mrs. Taylor in her cabin next door watched him ride off in the sleet,
      bound for the lonely mountain trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that girl don't get ready to take him pretty soon,&rdquo; she observed to
      her husband, &ldquo;I'll give her a piece of my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taylor was astonished. &ldquo;Is he thinking of her?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, Mr. Taylor, and why shouldn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Taylor scratched his head and returned to his newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was warm&mdash;warm and beautiful upon Bear Creek. Snow shone upon the
      peaks of the Bow Leg range; lower on their slopes the pines were stirring
      with a gentle song; and flowers bloomed across the wide plains at their
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly and her Virginian sat at a certain spring where he had often ridden
      with her. On this day he was bidding her farewell before undertaking the
      most important trust which Judge Henry had as yet given him. For this
      journey she had provided him with Sir Walter Scott's Kenilworth.
      Shakespeare he had returned to her. He had bought Shakespeare for himself.
      &ldquo;As soon as I got used to readin' it,&rdquo; he had told her, &ldquo;I knowed for
      certain that I liked readin' for enjoyment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was not of books that he had spoken much to-day. He had not spoken
      at all. He had bade her listen to the meadow-lark, when its song fell upon
      the silence like beaded drops of music. He had showed her where a covey of
      young willow-grouse were hiding as their horses passed. And then, without
      warning, as they sat by the spring, he had spoken potently of his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not interrupt him. She waited until he was wholly finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not the sort of wife you want,&rdquo; she said, with an attempt of
      airiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered roughly, &ldquo;I am the judge of that.&rdquo; And his roughness was a
      pleasure to her, yet it made her afraid of herself. When he was absent
      from her, and she could sit in her cabin and look at Grandmother Stark,
      and read home letters, then in imagination she found it easy to play the
      part which she had arranged to play regarding him&mdash;the part of the
      guide, and superior, and indulgent companion. But when he was by her side,
      that part became a difficult one. Her woman's fortress was shaken by a
      force unknown to her before. Sam Bannett did not have it in him to look as
      this man could look, when the cold lustre of his eyes grew hot with
      internal fire. What color they were baffled her still. &ldquo;Can it possibly
      change?&rdquo; she wondered. It seemed to her that sometimes when she had been
      looking from a rock straight down into clear sea water, this same color
      had lurked in its depths. &ldquo;Is it green, or is it gray?&rdquo; she asked herself,
      but did not turn just now to see. She kept her face toward the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All men are born equal,&rdquo; he now remarked slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she quickly answered, with a combative flash. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe that don't include women?&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do yu' tell the kids so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I teach them what I believe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pondered. &ldquo;I used to have to learn about the Declaration of
      Independence. I hated books and truck when I was a kid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I cert'nly don't. But I used to get kep' in at recess for bein' so
      dumb. I was most always at the tail end of the class. My brother, he'd be
      head sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little George Taylor is my prize scholar,&rdquo; said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knows his tasks, does he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always. And Henry Dow comes next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Bob Carmody. I spend more time on him than on all the rest put
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My!&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;Ain't that strange!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, puzzled by his tone. &ldquo;It's not strange when you know
      Bob,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very strange,&rdquo; drawled the Virginian. &ldquo;Knowin' Bob don't help it
      any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think that I understand you,&rdquo; said Molly, sticky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is mighty confusin'. George Taylor, he's your best scholar, and
      poor Bob, he's your worst, and there's a lot in the middle&mdash;and you
      tell me we're all born equal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly could only sit giggling in this trap he had so ingeniously laid for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what,&rdquo; pursued the cow-puncher, with slow and growing
      intensity, &ldquo;equality is a great big bluff. It's easy called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean&mdash;&rdquo; began Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, and let me say what I mean.&rdquo; He had made an imperious gesture with
      his hand. &ldquo;I know a man that mostly wins at cyards. I know a man that
      mostly loses. He says it is his luck. All right. Call it his luck. I know
      a man that works hard and he's gettin' rich, and I know another that works
      hard and is gettin' poor. He says it is his luck. All right. Call it his
      luck. I look around and I see folks movin' up or movin' down, winners or
      losers everywhere. All luck, of course. But since folks can be born that
      different in their luck, where's your equality? No, seh! call your failure
      luck, or call it laziness, wander around the words, prospect all yu' mind
      to, and yu'll come out the same old trail of inequality.&rdquo; He paused a
      moment and looked at her. &ldquo;Some holds four aces,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and some
      holds nothin', and some poor fello' gets the aces and no show to play 'em;
      but a man has got to prove himself my equal before I'll believe him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly sat gazing at him, silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what yu' meant,&rdquo; he told her now, &ldquo;by sayin' you're not the wife
      I'd want. But I am the kind that moves up. I am goin' to be your best
      scholar.&rdquo; He turned toward her, and that fortress within her began to
      shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Don't, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;spoil this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoil it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These rides&mdash;I don't love you&mdash;I can't&mdash;but these rides
      are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My greatest pleasure. There! And, please, I want them to go on so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on so! I don't reckon yu' know what you're sayin'. Yu' might as well
      ask fruit to stay green. If the way we are now can keep bein' enough for
      you, it can't for me. A pleasure to you, is it? Well, to me it is&mdash;I
      don't know what to call it. I come to yu' and I hate it, and I come again
      and I hate it, and I ache and grieve all over when I go. No! You will have
      to think of some other way than just invitin' me to keep green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am to see you&mdash;&rdquo; began the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not to see me. Not like this. I can stay away easier than what I
      am doin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you do me a favor, a great one?&rdquo; said she, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it as impossible as you please!&rdquo; he cried. He thought it was to be
      some action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on coming. But don't talk to me about&mdash;don't talk in that way&mdash;if
      you can help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed out, not permitting himself to swear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;if you can't help talking that way&mdash;sometimes&mdash;I
      promise I will listen. That is the only promise I make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a bargain,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he helped her mount her horse, restraining himself like a Spartan,
      and they rode home to her cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made it pretty near impossible,&rdquo; he said, as he took his leave.
      &ldquo;But you've been square to-day, and I'll show you I can be square when I
      come back. I'll not do more than ask you if your mind's the same. And now
      I'll not see you for quite a while. I am going a long way. But I'll be
      very busy. And bein' busy always keeps me from grievin' too much about
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strange is woman! She would rather have heard some other last remark than
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'll not miss you either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her. &ldquo;I doubt if yu' can help missin' me,&rdquo; he remarked. And
      he was gone at once, galloping on his Monte horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which of the two won a victory this day?

    <h2>
      XIII. THE GAME AND THE NATION&mdash;ACT FIRST
    </h2>
    <p>
      There can be no doubt of this: All America is divided into two classes,&mdash;the
      quality and the equality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter will always recognize the former when mistaken for it. Both
      will be with us until our women bear nothing but kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was through the Declaration of Independence that we Americans
      acknowledged the ETERNAL INEQUALITY of man. For by it we abolished a
      cut-and-dried aristocracy. We had seen little men artificially held up in
      high places, and great men artificially held down in low places, and our
      own justice-loving hearts abhorred this violence to human nature.
      Therefore, we decreed that every man should thenceforth have equal liberty
      to find his own level. By this very decree we acknowledged and gave
      freedom to true aristocracy, saying, &ldquo;Let the best man win, whoever he
      is.&rdquo; Let the best man win! That is America's word. That is true democracy.
      And true democracy and true aristocracy are one and the same thing. If
      anybody cannot see this, so much the worse for his eyesight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above reflections occurred to me before reaching Billings, Montana,
      some three weeks after I had unexpectedly met the Virginian at Omaha,
      Nebraska. I had not known of that trust given to him by Judge Henry, which
      was taking him East. I was looking to ride with him before long among the
      clean hills of Sunk Creek. I supposed he was there. But I came upon him
      one morning in Colonel Cyrus Jones's eating palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you know the palace? It stood in Omaha, near the trains, and it was
      ten years old (which is middle-aged in Omaha) when I first saw it. It was
      a shell of wood, painted with golden emblems,&mdash;the steamboat, the
      eagle, the Yosemite,&mdash;and a live bear ate gratuities at its entrance.
      Weather permitting, it opened upon the world as a stage upon the audience.
      You sat in Omaha's whole sight and dined, while Omaha's dust came and
      settled upon the refreshments. It is gone the way of the Indian and the
      buffalo, for the West is growing old. You should have seen the palace and
      sat there. In front of you passed rainbows of men,&mdash;Chinese, Indian
      chiefs, Africans, General Miles, younger sons, Austrian nobility, wide
      females in pink. Our continent drained prismatically through Omaha once.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I was passing that way also, walking for the sake of ventilation from a
      sleeping-car toward a bath, when the language of Colonel Cyrus Jones came
      out to me. The actual colonel I had never seen before. He stood at the
      rear of his palace in gray flowery mustaches and a Confederate uniform,
      telling the wishes of his guests to the cook through a hole. You always
      bought meal tickets at once, else you became unwelcome. Guests here had
      foibles at times, and a rapid exit was too easy. Therefore I bought a
      ticket. It was spring and summer since I had heard anything like the
      colonel. The Missouri had not yet flowed into New York dialect freely, and
      his vocabulary met me like the breeze of the plains. So I went in to be
      fanned by it, and there sat the Virginian at a table, alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      His greeting was up to the code of indifference proper on the plains; but
      he presently remarked, &ldquo;I'm right glad to see somebody,&rdquo; which was a good
      deal to say. &ldquo;Them that comes hyeh,&rdquo; he observed next, &ldquo;don't eat. They
      feed.&rdquo; And he considered the guests with a sombre attention. &ldquo;D' yu'
      reckon they find joyful digestion in this swallo'-an'-get-out trough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here, then?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pshaw! When yu' can't have what you choose, yu' just choose what you
      have.&rdquo; And he took the bill-of-fare. I began to know that he had something
      on his mind, so I did not trouble him further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile he sat studying the bill-of-fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever heard o' them?&rdquo; he inquired, shoving me the spotted document.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most improbable dishes were there,&mdash;salmis, canapes, supremes,&mdash;all
      perfectly spelt and absolutely transparent. It was the old trick of
      copying some metropolitan menu to catch travellers of the third and last
      dimension of innocence; and whenever this is done the food is of the third
      and last dimension of awfulness, which the cow-puncher knew as well as
      anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they keep that up here still,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about them?&rdquo; he repeated. His finger was at a special item,
      FROGS' LEGS  LA DELMONICO. &ldquo;Are they true anywheres?&rdquo; he asked. And I
      told him, certainly. I also explained to him about Delmonico of New York
      and about Augustin of Philadelphia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's not a little bit o' use in lyin' to me this mawnin',&rdquo; he said,
      with his engaging smile. &ldquo;I ain't goin' to awdeh anything's laigs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll see how he gets out of it,&rdquo; I said, remembering the odd Texas
      legend. (The traveller read the bill-of-fare, you know, and called for a
      vol-au-vent. And the proprietor looked at the traveller, and running a
      pistol into his ear, observed, &ldquo;You'll take hash.&rdquo;) I was thinking of this
      and wondering what would happen to me. So I took the step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wants frogs' legs, does he?&rdquo; shouted Colonel Cyrus Jones. He fixed his
      eye upon me, and it narrowed to a slit. &ldquo;Too many brain workers
      breakfasting before yu' came in, professor,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Missionary ate the
      last leg off me just now. Brown the wheat!&rdquo; he commanded, through the hole
      to the cook, for some one had ordered hot cakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have fried aiggs,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;Cooked both sides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White wings!&rdquo; sang the colonel through the hole. &ldquo;Let 'em fly up and
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee an' no milk,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw one in the dark!&rdquo; the colonel roared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And beefsteak, rare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One slaughter in the pan, and let the blood drip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like a glass of water, please,&rdquo; said I. The colonel threw me a
      look of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One Missouri and ice for the professor!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fello's a right live man,&rdquo; commented the Virginian. But he seemed
      thoughtful. Presently he inquired, &ldquo;Yu' say he was a foreigner, an'
      learned fancy cookin' to New Yawk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was this cow-puncher's way. Scarcely ever would he let drop a thing
      new to him until he had got from you your whole information about it. So I
      told him the history of Lorenzo Delmonico and his pioneer work, as much as
      I knew, and the Southerner listened intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty inter-estin',&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;mighty. He could just take little
      old o'rn'ry frawgs, and dandy 'em up to suit the bloods. Mighty
      inter-estin'. I expaict, though, his cookin' would give an outraiged
      stomach to a plain-raised man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to follow it up,&rdquo; said I, by way of a sudden experiment,
      &ldquo;Miss Molly Wood might have some book about French dishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Virginian did not turn a hair. &ldquo;I reckon she wouldn't,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;She was raised in Vermont. They don't bother overly about their
      eatin' up in Vermont. Hyeh's what Miss Wood recommended the las' time I
      was seein' her,&rdquo; the cow-puncher added, bringing Kenilworth from his
      pocket. &ldquo;Right fine story. That Queen Elizabeth must have cert'nly been a
      competent woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was,&rdquo; said I. But talk came to an end here. A dusty crew, most
      evidently from the plains, now entered and drifted to a table; and each
      man of them gave the Virginian about a quarter of a slouchy nod. His
      greeting to them was very serene. Only, Kenilworth went back into his
      pocket, and he breakfasted in silence. Among those who had greeted him I
      now recognized a face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's the man you played cards with at Medicine Bow!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Trampas. He's got a job at the ranch now.&rdquo; The Virginian said no
      more, but went on with his breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      His appearance was changed. Aged I would scarcely say, for this would seem
      as if he did not look young. But I think that the boy was altogether gone
      from his face&mdash;the boy whose freak with Steve had turned Medicine Bow
      upside down, whose other freak with the babies had outraged Bear Creek,
      the boy who had loved to jingle his spurs. But manhood had only trained,
      not broken, his youth. It was all there, only obedient to the rein and
      curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently we went together to the railway yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Judge is doing a right smart o' business this year,&rdquo; he began, very
      casually indeed, so that I knew this was important. Besides bells and coal
      smoke, the smell and crowded sounds of cattle rose in the air around us.
      &ldquo;Hyeh's our first gather o' beeves on the ranch,&rdquo; continued the Virginian.
      &ldquo;The whole lot's shipped through to Chicago in two sections over the
      Burlington. The Judge is fighting the Elkhorn road.&rdquo; We passed slowly
      along the two trains,&mdash;twenty cars, each car packed with huddled,
      round-eyed, gazing steers. He examined to see if any animals were down.
      &ldquo;They ain't ate or drank anything to speak of,&rdquo; he said, while the
      terrified brutes stared at us through their slats. &ldquo;Not since they struck
      the railroad they've not drank. Yu' might suppose they know somehow what
      they're travellin' to Chicago for.&rdquo; And casually, always casually, he told
      me the rest. Judge Henry could not spare his foreman away from the second
      gather of beeves. Therefore these two ten-car trains with their double
      crew of cow-boys had been given to the Virginian's charge. After Chicago,
      he was to return by St. Paul over the Northern Pacific; for the Judge had
      wished him to see certain of the road's directors and explain to them
      persuasively how good a thing it would be for them to allow especially
      cheap rates to the Sunk Creek outfit henceforth. This was all the
      Virginian told me; and it contained the whole matter, to be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're acting foreman,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, somebody has to have the say, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of course you hated the promotion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about promotion,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The boys have been used to
      seein' me one of themselves. Why don't you come along with us far as
      Plattsmouth?&rdquo; Thus he shifted the subject from himself, and called to my
      notice the locomotives backing up to his cars, and reminded me that from
      Plattsmouth I had the choice of two trains returning. But he could not
      hide or belittle this confidence of his employer in him. It was the care
      of several thousand perishable dollars and the control of men. It was a
      compliment. There were more steers than men to be responsible for; but
      none of the steers had been suddenly picked from the herd and set above
      his fellows. Moreover, Chicago finished up the steers; but the new-made
      deputy foreman had then to lead his six highly unoccupied brethren away
      from towns, and back in peace to the ranch, or disappoint the Judge, who
      needed their services. These things sometimes go wrong in a land where
      they say you are all born equal; and that quarter of a nod in Colonel
      Cyrus Jones's eating palace held more equality than any whole nod you
      could see. But the Virginian did not see it, there being a time for all
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      We trundled down the flopping, heavy-eddied Missouri to Plattsmouth, and
      there they backed us on to a siding, the Christian Endeavor being expected
      to pass that way. And while the equality absorbed themselves in a deep but
      harmless game of poker by the side of the railway line, the Virginian and
      I sat on the top of a car, contemplating the sandy shallows of the Platte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you'd take a hand,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poker? With them kittens?&rdquo; One flash of the inner man lightened in his
      eyes and died away, and he finished with his gentle drawl, &ldquo;When I play, I
      want it to be interestin'.&rdquo; He took out Sir Walter's Kenilworth once more,
      and turned the volume over and over slowly, without opening it. You cannot
      tell if in spirit he wandered on Bear Creek with the girl whose book it
      was. The spirit will go one road, and the thought another, and the body
      its own way sometimes. &ldquo;Queen Elizabeth would have played a mighty pow'ful
      game,&rdquo; was his next remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poker?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, seh. Do you expaict Europe has got any queen equal to her at
      present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I doubted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Victoria'd get pretty nigh slain sliding chips out agaynst Elizabeth.
      Only mos' prob'ly Victoria she'd insist on a half-cent limit. You have
      read this hyeh Kenilworth? Well, deal Elizabeth ace high, an' she could
      scare Robert Dudley with a full house plumb out o' the bettin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said that I believed she unquestionably could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said the Virginian, &ldquo;if Essex's play got next her too near, I
      reckon she'd have stacked the cyards. Say, d' yu' remember Shakespeare's
      fat man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Falstaff? Oh, yes, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't that grand? Why, he makes men talk the way they do in life. I
      reckon he couldn't get printed to-day. It's a right down shame Shakespeare
      couldn't know about poker. He'd have had Falstaff playing all day at that
      Tearsheet outfit. And the Prince would have beat him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prince had the brains,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brains?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, didn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I neveh thought to notice. Like as not he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Falstaff didn't, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, seh! Falstaff could have played whist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you know what you're talking about; I don't,&rdquo; said I, for he
      was drawling again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cow-puncher's eye rested a moment amiably upon me. &ldquo;You can play whist
      with your brains,&rdquo; he mused,&mdash;&ldquo;brains and cyards. Now cyards are only
      one o' the manifestations of poker in this hyeh world. One o' the shapes
      yu fool with it in when the day's work is oveh. If a man is built like
      that Prince boy was built (and it's away down deep beyond brains), he'll
      play winnin' poker with whatever hand he's holdin' when the trouble
      begins. Maybe it will be a mean, triflin' army, or an empty six-shooter,
      or a lame hawss, or maybe just nothin' but his natural countenance. 'Most
      any old thing will do for a fello' like that Prince boy to play poker
      with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'd be grateful for your definition of poker,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the Virginian looked me over amiably. &ldquo;You put up a mighty pretty
      game o' whist yourself,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Don't that give you the contented
      spirit?&rdquo; And before I had any reply to this, the Christian Endeavor began
      to come over the bridge. Three instalments crossed the Missouri from
      Pacific Junction, bound for Pike's Peak, every car swathed in bright
      bunting, and at each window a Christian with a handkerchief, joyously
      shrieking. Then the cattle trains got the open signal, and I jumped off.
      &ldquo;Tell the Judge the steers was all right this far,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the last of the deputy foreman for a while.

    <h2>
      XIV. BETWEEN THE ACTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      My road to Sunk Creek lay in no straight line. By rail I diverged
      northwest to Fort Meade, and thence, after some stay with the kind
      military people, I made my way on a horse. Up here in the Black Hills it
      sluiced rain most intolerably. The horse and I enjoyed the country and
      ourselves but little; and when finally I changed from the saddle into a
      stagecoach, I caught a thankful expression upon the animal's face, and
      returned the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six legs inside this jerky to-night?&rdquo; said somebody, as I climbed the
      wheel. &ldquo;Well, we'll give thanks for not havin' eight,&rdquo; he added
      cheerfully. &ldquo;Clamp your mind on to that, Shorty.&rdquo; And he slapped the
      shoulder of his neighbor. Naturally I took these two for old companions.
      But we were all total strangers. They told me of the new gold excitement
      at Rawhide, and supposed it would bring up the Northern Pacific; and when
      I explained the millions owed to this road's German bondholders, they were
      of opinion that a German would strike it richer at Rawhide. We spoke of
      all sorts of things, and in our silence I gloated on the autumn holiday
      promised me by Judge Henry. His last letter had said that an outfit would
      be starting for his ranch from Billings on the seventh, and he would have
      a horse for me. This was the fifth. So we six legs in the jerky travelled
      harmoniously on over the rain-gutted road, getting no deeper knowledge of
      each other than what our outsides might imply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that we concealed anything. The man who had slapped Shorty introduced
      himself early. &ldquo;Scipio le Moyne, from Gallipolice, Ohio,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
      eldest of us always gets called Scipio. It's French. But us folks have
      been white for a hundred years.&rdquo; He was limber and light-muscled, and fell
      skilfully about, evading bruises when the jerky reeled or rose on end. He
      had a strange, long, jocular nose, very wary-looking, and a bleached blue
      eye. Cattle was his business, as a rule, but of late he had been &ldquo;looking
      around some,&rdquo; and Rawhide seemed much on his brain. Shorty struck me as
      &ldquo;looking around&rdquo; also. He was quite short, indeed, and the jerky hurt him
      almost every time. He was light-haired and mild. Think of a yellow dog
      that is lost, and fancies each newcomer in sight is going to turn out his
      master, and you will have Shorty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the Northern Pacific that surprised us into intimacy. We were
      nearing Medora. We had made a last arrangement of our legs. I lay
      stretched in silence, placid in the knowledge it was soon to end. So I
      drowsed. I felt something sudden, and, waking, saw Scipio passing through
      the air. As Shorty next shot from the jerky, I beheld smoke and the
      locomotive. The Northern Pacific had changed its schedule. A valise is a
      poor companion for catching a train with. There was rutted sand and lumpy,
      knee-high grease wood in our short cut. A piece of stray wire sprang from
      some hole and hung caracoling about my ankle. Tin cans spun from my
      stride. But we made a conspicuous race. Two of us waved hats, and there
      was no moment that some one of us was not screeching. It meant twenty-four
      hours to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps we failed to catch the train's attention, though the theory seems
      monstrous. As it moved off in our faces, smooth and easy and insulting,
      Scipio dropped instantly to a walk, and we two others outstripped him and
      came desperately to the empty track. There went the train. Even still its
      puffs were the separated puffs of starting, that bitten-off, snorty kind,
      and sweat and our true natures broke freely forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kicked my valise, and then sat on it, dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shorty yielded himself up aloud. All his humble secrets came out of him.
      He walked aimlessly round, lamenting. He had lost his job, and he
      mentioned the ranch. He had played cards, and he mentioned the man. He had
      sold his horse and saddle to catch a friend on this train, and he
      mentioned what the friend had been going to do for him. He told a string
      of griefs and names to the air, as if the air knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Scipio arrived with extreme leisure at the rails. He stuck his
      hands into his pockets and his head out at the very small train. His
      bleached blue eyes shut to slits as he watched the rear car in its
      smoke-blur ooze away westward among the mounded bluffs. &ldquo;Lucky it's out of
      range,&rdquo; I thought. But now Scipio spoke to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you seem to think you've left me behind,&rdquo; he began easily, in
      fawning tones. &ldquo;You're too much of a kid to have such thoughts. Age some.&rdquo;
       His next remark grew less wheedling. &ldquo;I wouldn't be a bit proud to meet
      yu'. Why, if I was seen travellin' with yu', I'd have to explain it to my
      friends! Think you've got me left, do yu'? Just because yu' ride through
      this country on a rail, do yu' claim yu' can find your way around? I could
      take yu' out ten yards in the brush and lose yu' in ten seconds, you
      spangle-roofed hobo! Leave ME behind? you recent blanket-mortgage
      yearlin'! You plush-lined, nickel-plated, whistlin' wash room, d' yu'
      figure I can't go east just as soon as west? Or I'll stay right here if it
      suits me, yu' dude-inhabited hot-box! Why, yu' coon-bossed face-towel&mdash;&rdquo;
       But from here he rose in flights of novelty that appalled and held me
      spellbound, and which are not for me to say to you. Then he came down
      easily again, and finished with expressions of sympathy for it because it
      could never have known a mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expaict it could show a male parent offhand?&rdquo; inquired a slow
      voice behind us. I jumped round, and there was the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Male parent!&rdquo; scoffed the prompt Scipio. &ldquo;Ain't you heard about THEM
      yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them? Was there two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two? The blamed thing was sired by a whole doggone Dutch syndicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the piebald son of a gun!&rdquo; responded the Virginian, sweetly. &ldquo;I got
      them steers through all right,&rdquo; he added to me. &ldquo;Sorry to see yu' get so
      out o' breath afteh the train. Is your valise sufferin' any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's he?&rdquo; inquired Scipio, curiously, turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Southerner sat with a newspaper on the rear platform of a caboose. The
      caboose stood hitched behind a mile or so of freight train, and the train
      was headed west. So here was the deputy foreman, his steers delivered in
      Chicago, his men (I could hear them) safe in the caboose, his paper in his
      lap, and his legs dangling at ease over the railing. He wore the look of a
      man for whom things are going smooth. And for me the way to Billings was
      smooth now, also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's he?&rdquo; Scipio repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from inside the caboose loud laughter and noise broke on us. Some one
      was reciting &ldquo;And it's my night to howl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll all howl when we get to Rawhide,&rdquo; said some other one; and they
      howled now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These hyeh steam cyars,&rdquo; said the Virginian to Scipio, &ldquo;make a man's
      language mighty nigh as speedy as his travel.&rdquo; Of Shorty he took no notice
      whatever&mdash;no more than of the manifestations in the caboose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So yu' heard me speakin' to the express,&rdquo; said Scipio. &ldquo;Well, I guess,
      sometimes I&mdash;See here,&rdquo; he exclaimed, for the Virginian was gravely
      considering him, &ldquo;I may have talked some, but I walked a whole lot. You
      didn't catch ME squandering no speed. Soon as&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed,&rdquo; said the Virginian, &ldquo;thinkin' came quicker to yu' than
      runnin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was glad I was not Shorty, to have my measure taken merely by my way of
      missing a train. And of course I was sorry that I had kicked my valise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I could tell yu'd been enjoyin' us!&rdquo; said Scipio. &ldquo;Observin' somebody
      else's scrape always kind o' rests me too. Maybe you're a philosopher, but
      maybe there's a pair of us drawd in this deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Approval now grew plain upon the face of the Virginian. &ldquo;By your laigs,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;you are used to the saddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd be called used to it, I expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By your hands,&rdquo; said the Southerner, again, &ldquo;you ain't roped many steers
      lately. Been cookin' or something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; retorted Scipio, &ldquo;tell my future some now. Draw a conclusion from
      my mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm right distressed,&rdquo; answered the gentle Southerner, &ldquo;we've not a drop
      in the outfit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, drink with me uptown!&rdquo; cried Scipio. &ldquo;I'm pleased to death with yu'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian glanced where the saloons stood just behind the station, and
      shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it ain't a bit far to whiskey from here!&rdquo; urged the other,
      plaintively. &ldquo;Step down, now. Scipio le Moyne's my name. Yes, you're
      lookin' for my brass ear-rings. But there ain't no ear-rings on me. I've
      been white for a hundred years. Step down. I've a forty-dollar thirst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're certainly white,&rdquo; began the Virginian. &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the caboose resumed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I'm wild, and woolly, and full of peas;
      I'm hard to curry above the knees;
      I'm a she-wolf from Bitter Creek, and
      It's my night to ho-o-wl&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And as they howled and stamped, the wheels of the caboose began to turn
      gently and to murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian rose suddenly. &ldquo;Will yu' save that thirst and take a
      forty-dollar job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missin' trains, profanity, or what?&rdquo; said Scipio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell yu' soon as I'm sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Scipio looked hard at the Virginian. &ldquo;Why, you're talkin'
      business!&rdquo; said he, and leaped on the caboose, where I was already. &ldquo;I WAS
      thinkin' of Rawhide,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but I ain't any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good luck!&rdquo; said Shorty, on the track behind us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, say!&rdquo; said Scipio, &ldquo;he wanted to go on that train, just like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get on,&rdquo; called the Virginian. &ldquo;But as to getting a job, he ain't just
      like you.&rdquo; So Shorty came, like a lost dog when you whistle to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our wheels clucked over the main-line switch. A train-hand threw it shut
      after us, jumped aboard, and returned forward over the roofs. Inside the
      caboose they had reached the third howling of the she-wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends of yourn?&rdquo; said Scipio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My outfit,&rdquo; drawled the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do yu' always travel outside?&rdquo; inquired Scipio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's lonesome in there,&rdquo; returned the deputy foreman. And here one of
      them came out, slamming the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; he said, at sight of the distant town. Then, truculently, to the
      Virginian, &ldquo;I told you I was going to get a bottle here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have your bottle, then,&rdquo; said the deputy foreman, and kicked him off into
      Dakota. (It was not North Dakota yet; they had not divided it.) The
      Virginian had aimed his pistol at about the same time with his boot.
      Therefore the man sat in Dakota quietly, watching us go away into Montana,
      and offering no objections. Just before he became too small to make out,
      we saw him rise and remove himself back toward the saloons.

      XV. THE GAME AND THE NATION&mdash;ACT SECOND
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the only step I have had to take this whole trip,&rdquo; said the
      Virginian. He holstered his pistol with a jerk. &ldquo;I have been fearing he
      would force it on me.&rdquo; And he looked at empty, receding Dakota with
      disgust. &ldquo;So nyeh back home!&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Known your friend long?&rdquo; whispered Scipio to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairly,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scipio's bleached eyes brightened with admiration as he considered the
      Southerner's back. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he stated judicially, &ldquo;start awful early when
      yu' go to fool with him, or he'll make you feel unpunctual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expaict I've had them almost all of three thousand miles,&rdquo; said the
      Virginian, tilting his head toward the noise in the caboose. &ldquo;And I've
      strove to deliver them back as I received them. The whole lot. And I would
      have. But he has spoiled my hopes.&rdquo; The deputy foreman looked again at
      Dakota. &ldquo;It's a disappointment,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;You may know what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had known a little, but not to the very deep, of the man's pride and
      purpose in this trust. Scipio gave him sympathy. &ldquo;There must be quite a
      balance of 'em left with yu' yet,&rdquo; said Scipio, cheeringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had the boys plumb contented,&rdquo; pursued the deputy foreman, hurt into
      open talk of himself. &ldquo;Away along as far as Saynt Paul I had them
      reconciled to my authority. Then this news about gold had to strike us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they're a-dreamin' nuggets and Parisian bowleyvards,&rdquo; suggested
      Scipio.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian smiled gratefully at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortune is shinin' bright and blindin' to their delicate young eyes,&rdquo; he
      said, regaining his usual self.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all listened a moment to the rejoicings within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Energetic, ain't they?&rdquo; said the Southerner. &ldquo;But none of 'em was whelped
      savage enough to sing himself bloodthirsty. And though they're strainin'
      mighty earnest not to be tame, they're goin' back to Sunk Creek with me
      accordin' to the Judge's awders. Never a calf of them will desert to
      Rawhide, for all their dangerousness; nor I ain't goin' to have any fuss
      over it. Only one is left now that don't sing. Maybe I will have to make
      some arrangements about him. The man I have parted with,&rdquo; he said, with
      another glance at Dakota, &ldquo;was our cook, and I will ask yu' to replace
      him, Colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scipio gaped wide. &ldquo;Colonel! Say!&rdquo; He stared at the Virginian. &ldquo;Did I meet
      yu' at the palace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exackly meet,&rdquo; replied the Southerner. &ldquo;I was present one mawnin'
      las' month when this gentleman awdehed frawgs' laigs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sakes and saints, but that was a mean position!&rdquo; burst out Scipio. &ldquo;I had
      to tell all comers anything all day. Stand up and jump language hot off my
      brain at 'em. And the pay don't near compensate for the drain on the
      system. I don't care how good a man is, you let him keep a-tappin' his
      presence of mind right along, without takin' a lay-off, and you'll have
      him sick. Yes, sir. You'll hit his nerves. So I told them they could hire
      some fresh man, for I was goin' back to punch cattle or fight Indians, or
      take a rest somehow, for I didn't propose to get jaded, and me only
      twenty-five years old. There ain't no regular Colonel Cyrus Jones any
      more, yu' know. He met a Cheyenne telegraph pole in seventy-four, and was
      buried. But his palace was doin' big business, and he had been a kind of
      attraction, and so they always keep a live bear outside, and some poor
      fello', fixed up like the Colonel used to be, inside. And it's a turruble
      mean position. Course I'll cook for yu'. Yu've a dandy memory for faces!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't right convinced till I kicked him off and you gave that shut to
      your eyes again,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the door opened. A man with slim black eyebrows, slim black
      mustache, and a black shirt tied with a white handkerchief was looking
      steadily from one to the other of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day!&rdquo; he remarked generally and without enthusiasm; and to the
      Virginian, &ldquo;Where's Schoffner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expaict he'll have got his bottle by now, Trampas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trampas looked from one to the other of us again. &ldquo;Didn't he say he was
      coming back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He reminded me he was going for a bottle, and afteh that he didn't wait
      to say a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trampas looked at the platform and the railing and the steps. &ldquo;He told me
      he was coming back,&rdquo; he insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't reckon he has come, not without he clumb up ahaid somewhere. An'
      I mus' say, when he got off he didn't look like a man does when he has the
      intention o' returnin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Scipio coughed, and pared his nails attentively. We had already
      been avoiding each other's eye. Shorty did not count. Since he got aboard,
      his meek seat had been the bottom step.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thoughts of Trampas seemed to be in difficulty. &ldquo;How long's this train
      been started?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This hyeh train?&rdquo; The Virginian consulted his watch. &ldquo;Why, it's been
      fanning it a right smart little while,&rdquo; said he, laying no stress upon his
      indolent syllables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; went Trampas. He gave the rest of us a final unlovely scrutiny. &ldquo;It
      seems to have become a passenger train,&rdquo; he said. And he returned abruptly
      inside the caboose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he the member who don't sing?&rdquo; asked Scipio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the specimen,&rdquo; replied the Southerner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He don't seem musical in the face,&rdquo; said Scipio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; returned the Virginian. &ldquo;Why, you surely ain't the man to mind
      ugly mugs when they're hollow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The noise inside had dropped quickly to stillness. You could scarcely
      catch the sound of talk. Our caboose was clicking comfortably westward,
      rail after rail, mile upon mile, while night was beginning to rise from
      earth into the clouded sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if they have sent a search party forward to hunt Schoffner?&rdquo;
       said the Virginian. &ldquo;I think I'll maybe join their meeting.&rdquo; He opened the
      door upon them. &ldquo;Kind o' dark hyeh, ain't it?&rdquo; said he. And lighting the
      lantern, he shut us out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do yu' think?&rdquo; said Scipio to me. &ldquo;Will he take them to Sunk Creek?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He evidently thinks he will,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;He says he will, and he has the
      courage of his convictions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ain't near enough courage to have!&rdquo; Scipio exclaimed. &ldquo;There's times
      in life when a man has got to have courage WITHOUT convictions&mdash;WITHOUT
      them&mdash;or he is no good. Now your friend is that deep constitooted
      that you don't know and I don't know what he's thinkin' about all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there's to be any gun-play,&rdquo; put in the excellent Shorty, &ldquo;I'll stand
      in with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, go to bed with your gun-play!&rdquo; retorted Scipio, entirely
      good-humored. &ldquo;Is the Judge paying for a carload of dead punchers to
      gather his beef for him? And this ain't a proposition worth a man's
      gettin' hurt for himself, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; Shorty assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; speculated Scipio, as the night drew deeper round us and the caboose
      click-clucked and click-clucked over the rail joints; &ldquo;he's waitin' for
      somebody else to open this pot. I'll bet he don't know but one thing now,
      and that's that nobody else shall know he don't know anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scipio had delivered himself. He lighted a cigarette, and no more wisdom
      came from him. The night was established. The rolling bad-lands sank away
      in it. A train-hand had arrived over the roof, and hanging the red lights
      out behind, left us again without remark or symptom of curiosity. The
      train-hands seemed interested in their own society and lived in their own
      caboose. A chill wind with wet in it came blowing from the invisible
      draws, and brought the feel of the distant mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Montana!&rdquo; said Scipio, snuffing. &ldquo;I am glad to have it inside my
      lungs again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't yu' getting cool out there?&rdquo; said the Virginian's voice. &ldquo;Plenty
      room inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he had expected us to follow him; or perhaps he had meant us to
      delay long enough not to seem like a reenforcement. &ldquo;These gentlemen
      missed the express at Medora,&rdquo; he observed to his men, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      What they took us for upon our entrance I cannot say, or what they
      believed. The atmosphere of the caboose was charged with voiceless
      currents of thought. By way of a friendly beginning to the three hundred
      miles of caboose we were now to share so intimately, I recalled myself to
      them. I trusted no more of the Christian Endeavor had delayed them. &ldquo;I am
      so lucky to have caught you again,&rdquo; I finished. &ldquo;I was afraid my last
      chance of reaching the Judge's had gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus I said a number of things designed to be agreeable, but they met my
      small talk with the smallest talk you can have. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; for instance, and
      &ldquo;Pretty well, I guess,&rdquo; and grave strikings of matches and thoughtful
      looks at the floor. I suppose we had made twenty miles to the
      imperturbable clicking of the caboose when one at length asked his
      neighbor had he ever seen New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Flooded with dudes, ain't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swimmin',&rdquo; said the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leakin', too,&rdquo; said a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my gracious!&rdquo; said a fourth, and beat his knee in private delight.
      None of them ever looked at me. For some reason I felt exceedingly ill at
      ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good clothes in New York,&rdquo; said the third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rich food,&rdquo; said the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fresh eggs, too,&rdquo; said the third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my gracious!&rdquo; said the fourth, beating his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; observed the Virginian, unexpectedly; &ldquo;they tell me that aiggs
      there ain't liable to be so rotten as yu'll strike 'em in this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      None of them had a reply for this, and New York was abandoned. For some
      reason I felt much better.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a new line they adopted next, led off by Trampas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to the excitement?&rdquo; he inquired, selecting Shorty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excitement?&rdquo; said Shorty, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to Rawhide?&rdquo; Trampas repeated. And all watched Shorty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I'm all adrift missin' that express,&rdquo; said Shorty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I can give you employment,&rdquo; suggested the Virginian. &ldquo;I am taking
      an outfit across the basin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find most folks going to Rawhide, if you're looking for company,&rdquo;
       pursued Trampas, fishing for a recruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about Rawhide, anyway?&rdquo; said Scipio, skillfully deflecting this
      missionary work. &ldquo;Are they taking much mineral out? Have yu' seen any of
      the rock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rock?&rdquo; broke in the enthusiast who had beaten his knee. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; And he
      brought some from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're always showing your rock,&rdquo; said Trampas, sulkily; for Scipio now
      held the conversation, and Shorty returned safely to his dozing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm!&rdquo; went Scipio at the rock. He turned it back and forth in his hand,
      looking it over; he chucked and caught it slightingly in the air, and
      handed it back. &ldquo;Porphyry, I see.&rdquo; That was his only word about it. He
      said it cheerily. He left no room for discussion. You could not damn a
      thing worse. &ldquo;Ever been in Santa Rita?&rdquo; pursued Scipio, while the
      enthusiast slowly pushed his rock back into his pocket. &ldquo;That's down in
      New Mexico. Ever been to Globe, Arizona?&rdquo; And Scipio talked away about the
      mines he had known. There was no getting at Shorty any more that evening.
      Trampas was foiled of his fish, or of learning how the fish's heart lay.
      And by morning Shorty had been carefully instructed to change his mind
      about once an hour. This is apt to discourage all but very superior
      missionaries. And I too escaped for the rest of this night. At Glendive we
      had a dim supper, and I bought some blankets; and after that it was late,
      and sleep occupied the attention of us all.
    </p>
    <p>
      We lay along the shelves of the caboose, a peaceful sight I should think,
      in that smoothly trundling cradle. I slept almost immediately, so tired
      that not even our stops or anything else waked me, save once, when the air
      I was breathing grew suddenly pure, and I roused. Sitting in the door was
      the lonely figure of the Virginian. He leaned in silent contemplation of
      the occasional moon, and beneath it the Yellowstone's swift ripples. On
      the caboose shelves the others slept sound and still, each stretched or
      coiled as he had first put himself. They were not untrustworthy to look
      at, it seemed to me&mdash;except Trampas. You would have said the rest of
      that young humanity was average rough male blood, merely needing to be
      told the proper things at the right time; and one big bunchy stocking of
      the enthusiast stuck out of his blanket, solemn and innocent, and I
      laughed at it. There was a light sound by the door, and I found the
      Virginian's eye on me. Finding who it was, he nodded and motioned with his
      hand to go to sleep. And this I did with him in my sight, still leaning in
      the open door, through which came the interrupted moon and the swimming
      reaches of the Yellowstone.

      XVI. THE GAME AND THE NATION&mdash;LAST ACT
    </h2>
    <p>
      It has happened to you, has it not, to wake in the morning and wonder for
      a while where on earth you are? Thus I came half to life in the caboose,
      hearing voices, but not the actual words at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      But presently, &ldquo;Hathaway!&rdquo; said some one more clearly. &ldquo;Portland 1291!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This made no special stir in my intelligence, and I drowsed off again to
      the pleasant rhythm of the wheels. The little shock of stopping next
      brought me to, somewhat, with the voices still round me; and when we were
      again in motion, I heard: &ldquo;Rosebud! Portland 1279!&rdquo; These figures jarred
      me awake, and I said, &ldquo;It was 1291 before,&rdquo; and sat up in my blankets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greeting they vouchsafed and the sight of them clustering
      expressionless in the caboose brought last evening's uncomfortable memory
      back to me. Our next stop revealed how things were going to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forsythe,&rdquo; one of them read on the station. &ldquo;Portland 1266.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were counting the lessening distance westward. This was the
      undercurrent of war. It broke on me as I procured fresh water at Forsythe
      and made some toilet in their stolid presence. We were drawing nearer the
      Rawhide station&mdash;the point, I mean, where you left the railway for
      the new mines. Now Rawhide station lay this side of Billings. The broad
      path of desertion would open ready for their feet when the narrow path to
      duty and Sunk Creek was still some fifty miles more to wait. Here was
      Trampas's great strength; he need make no move meanwhile, but lie low for
      the immediate temptation to front and waylay them and win his battle over
      the deputy foreman. But the Virginian seemed to find nothing save
      enjoyment in this sunny September morning, and ate his breakfast at
      Forsythe serenely.
    </p>
    <p>
      That meal done and that station gone, our caboose took up again its easy
      trundle by the banks of the Yellowstone. The mutineers sat for a while
      digesting in idleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your scar?&rdquo; inquired one at length inspecting casually the neck of
      his neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foolishness,&rdquo; the other answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yourn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know but I prefer to have myself to thank for a thing,&rdquo;
       said the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was displaying myself,&rdquo; continued the second. &ldquo;One day last summer it
      was. We come on a big snake by Torrey Creek corral. The boys got betting
      pretty lively that I dassent make my word good as to dealing with him, so
      I loped my cayuse full tilt by Mr. Snake, and swung down and catched him
      up by the tail from the ground, and cracked him same as a whip, and
      snapped his head off. You've saw it done?&rdquo; he said to the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience nodded wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the loose head flew agin me, and the fangs caught. I was pretty sick
      for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't pay to be clumsy,&rdquo; said the first man. &ldquo;If you'd snapped the
      snake away from yu' instead of toward yu', its head would have whirled off
      into the brush, same as they do with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How like a knife-cut your scar looks!&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't it?&rdquo; said the snake-snapper. &ldquo;There's many that gets fooled by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An antelope knows a snake is his enemy,&rdquo; said another to me. &ldquo;Ever seen a
      buck circling round and round a rattler?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always wanted to see that,&rdquo; said I, heartily. For this I knew to
      be a respectable piece of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's worth seeing,&rdquo; the man went on. &ldquo;After the buck gets close in, he
      gives an almighty jump up in the air, and down comes his four hoofs in a
      bunch right on top of Mr. Snake. Cuts him all to hash. Now you tell me how
      the buck knows that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course I could not tell him. And again we sat in silence for a while&mdash;friendlier
      silence, I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A skunk'll kill yu' worse than a snake bite,&rdquo; said another, presently.
      &ldquo;No, I don't mean that way,&rdquo; he added. For I had smiled. &ldquo;There is a brown
      skunk down in Arkansaw. Kind of prairie-dog brown. Littler than our
      variety, he is. And he is mad the whole year round, same as a dog gets.
      Only the dog has a spell and dies but this here Arkansaw skunk is mad
      right along, and it don't seem to interfere with his business in other
      respects. Well, suppose you're camping out, and suppose it's a hot night,
      or you're in a hurry, and you've made camp late, or anyway you haven't got
      inside any tent, but you have just bedded down in the open. Skunk comes
      travelling along and walks on your blankets. You're warm. He likes that,
      same as a cat does. And he tramps with pleasure and comfort, same as a
      cat. And you move. You get bit, that's all. And you die of hydrophobia.
      Ask anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most extraordinary!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But did you ever see a person die from
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Never happened to. My cousin at Bald Knob did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Died?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Saw a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do you know they're not sick skunks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! They're well skunks. Well as anything. You'll not meet skunks in
      any state of the Union more robust than them in Arkansaw. And thick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's awful true,&rdquo; sighed another. &ldquo;I have buried hundreds of dollars'
      worth of clothes in Arkansaw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't yu' travel in a sponge bag?&rdquo; inquired Scipio. And this brought
      a slight silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speakin' of bites,&rdquo; spoke up a new man, &ldquo;how's that?&rdquo; He held up his
      thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My!&rdquo; breathed Scipio. &ldquo;Must have been a lion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man wore a wounded look. &ldquo;I was huntin' owl eggs for a botanist from
      Boston,&rdquo; he explained to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chiropodist, weren't he?&rdquo; said Scipio. &ldquo;Or maybe a sonnabulator?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, honest,&rdquo; protested the man with the thumb; so that I was sorry for
      him, and begged him to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll listen to you,&rdquo; I assured him. And I wondered why this politeness of
      mine should throw one or two of them into stifled mirth. Scipio, on the
      other hand, gave me a disgusted look and sat back sullenly for a moment,
      and then took himself out on the platform, where the Virginian was
      lounging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young feller wore knee-pants and ever so thick spectacles with a
      half-moon cut in 'em,&rdquo; resumed the narrator, &ldquo;and he carried a tin box
      strung to a strap I took for his lunch till it flew open on him and a horn
      toad hustled out. Then I was sure he was a botanist&mdash;or whatever yu'
      say they're called. Well, he would have owl eggs&mdash;them little
      prairie-owl that some claim can turn their head clean around and keep
      a-watchin' yu', only that's nonsense. We was ridin' through that
      prairie-dog town, used to be on the flat just after yu' crossed the south
      fork of Powder River on the Buffalo trail, and I said I'd dig an owl nest
      out for him if he was willing to camp till I'd dug it. I wanted to know
      about them owls some myself&mdash;if they did live with the dogs and
      snakes, yu' know,&rdquo; he broke off, appealing to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I told him eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So while the botanist went glarin' around the town with his glasses to
      see if he could spot a prairie-dog and an owl usin' the same hole, I was
      diggin' in a hole I'd seen an owl run down. And that's what I got.&rdquo; He
      held up his thumb again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The snake!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Mr. Rattler was keepin' house that day. Took me right there. I
      hauled him out of the hole hangin' to me. Eight rattles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;A big one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Thought I was dead. But the woman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, woman. Didn't I tell yu' the botanist had his wife along? Well, he
      did. And she acted better than the man, for he was losin' his head, and
      shoutin' he had no whiskey, and he didn't guess his knife was sharp enough
      to amputate my thumb, and none of us chewed, and the doctor was twenty
      miles away, and if he had only remembered to bring his ammonia&mdash;well,
      he was screeching out 'most everything he knew in the world, and without
      arranging it any, neither. But she just clawed his pocket and burrowed and
      kep' yelling, 'Give him the stone, Augustus!' And she whipped out one of
      them Injun medicine-stones,&mdash;first one I ever seen,&mdash;and she
      clapped it on to my thumb, and it started in right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did it do?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sucked. Like blotting-paper does. Soft and funny it was, and gray. They
      get 'em from elks' stomachs, yu' know. And when it had sucked the poison
      out of the wound, off it falls of my thumb by itself! And I thanked the
      woman for saving my life that capable and keeping her head that cool. I
      never knowed how excited she had been till afterward. She was awful
      shocked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she started to talk when the danger was over,&rdquo; said I, with
      deep silence around me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she didn't say nothing to me. But when her next child was born, it
      had eight rattles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Din now rose wild in the caboose. They rocked together. The enthusiast
      beat his knee tumultuously. And I joined them. Who could help it? It had
      been so well conducted from the imperceptible beginning. Fact and
      falsehood blended with such perfect art. And this last, an effect so new
      made with such world-old material! I cared nothing that I was the victim,
      and I joined them; but ceased, feeling suddenly somehow estranged or
      chilled. It was in their laughter. The loudness was too loud. And I caught
      the eyes of Trampas fixed upon the Virginian with exultant malevolence.
      Scipio's disgusted glance was upon me from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dazed by these signs, I went out on the platform to get away from the
      noise. There the Virginian said to me: &ldquo;Cheer up! You'll not be so easy
      for 'em that-a-way next season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said no more; and with his legs dangled over the railing, appeared to
      resume his newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; said I to Scipio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't mind if he don't,&rdquo; Scipio answered. &ldquo;Couldn't yu' see? I
      tried to head 'em off from yu' all I knew, but yu' just ran in among 'em
      yourself. Couldn't yu' see? Kep' hinderin' and spoilin' me with askin'
      those urgent questions of yourn&mdash;why, I had to let yu' go your way!
      Why, that wasn't the ordinary play with the ordinary tenderfoot they
      treated you to! You ain't a common tenderfoot this trip. You're the
      foreman's friend. They've hit him through you. That's the way they count
      it. It's made them encouraged. Can't yu' see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scipio stated it plainly. And as we ran by the next station, &ldquo;Howard!&rdquo;
       they harshly yelled. &ldquo;Portland 1256!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had been passing gangs of workmen on the track. And at that last yell
      the Virginian rose. &ldquo;I reckon I'll join the meeting again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This
      filling and repairing looks like the washout might have been true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Washout?&rdquo; said Scipio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big Horn bridge, they say&mdash;four days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I wish it came this side Rawhide station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do yu'?&rdquo; drawled the Virginian. And smiling at Scipio, he lounged in
      through the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He beats me,&rdquo; said Scipio, shaking his head. &ldquo;His trail is turruble hard
      to anticipate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work bein' done on the road, I see,&rdquo; the Virginian was saying, very
      friendly and conversational.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We see it too,&rdquo; said the voice of Trampas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seem to be easin' their grades some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roads do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheaper to build 'em the way they want 'em at the start, a man would
      think,&rdquo; suggested the Virginian, most friendly. &ldquo;There go some more
      I-talians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're Chinese,&rdquo; said Trampas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; acknowledged the Virginian, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's he monkeyin' at now?&rdquo; muttered Scipio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without cheap foreigners they couldn't afford all this hyeh new gradin',&rdquo;
       the Southerner continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grading! Can't you tell when a flood's been eating the banks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said the Virginian, sweet as honey. &ldquo;But 'ain't yu' heard of
      the improvements west of Big Timber, all the way to Missoula, this season?
      I'm talkin' about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Talking about them. Yes, I've heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good money-savin' scheme, ain't it?&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;Lettin' a
      freight run down one hill an' up the next as far as she'll go without
      steam, an' shavin' the hill down to that point.&rdquo; Now this was an honest
      engineering fact. &ldquo;Better'n settin' dudes squintin' through telescopes and
      cypherin' over one per cent reductions,&rdquo; the Southerner commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's common sense,&rdquo; assented Trampas. &ldquo;Have you heard the new scheme
      about the water-tanks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't right certain,&rdquo; said the Southerner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must watch this,&rdquo; said Scipio, &ldquo;or I shall bust.&rdquo; He went in, and so
      did I.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all sitting over this discussion of the Northern Pacific's
      recent policy as to betterments, as though they were the board of
      directors. Pins could have dropped. Only nobody would have cared to hear a
      pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They used to put all their tanks at the bottom of their grades,&rdquo; said
      Trampas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yu' get the water easier at the bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can pump it to the top, though,&rdquo; said Trampas, growing superior. &ldquo;And
      it's cheaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That gets me,&rdquo; said the Virginian, interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trains after watering can start down hill now and get the benefit of the
      gravity. It'll cut down operating expenses a heap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's cert'nly common sense!&rdquo; exclaimed the Virginian, absorbed. &ldquo;But
      ain't it kind o' tardy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Live and learn. So they gained speed, too. High speed on half the coal
      this season, until the accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accident!&rdquo; said the Virginian, instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yellowstone Limited. Man fired at engine driver. Train was flying past
      that quick the bullet broke every window and killed a passenger on the
      back platform. You've been running too much with aristocrats,&rdquo; finished
      Trampas, and turned on his heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haw, hew!&rdquo; began the enthusiast, but his neighbor gripped him to silence.
      This was a triumph too serious for noise. Not a mutineer moved; and I felt
      cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trampas,&rdquo; said the Virginian, &ldquo;I thought yu'd be afeared to try it on
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trampas whirled round. His hand was at his belt. &ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; he sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shorty!&rdquo; said Scipio, sternly, and leaping upon that youth, took his
      half-drawn pistol from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm obliged to yu',&rdquo; said the Virginian to Scipio. Trampas's hand left
      his belt. He threw a slight, easy look at his men, and keeping his back to
      the Virginian, walked out on the platform and sat on the chair where the
      Virginian had sat so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you comprehend,&rdquo; said the Virginian to Shorty, amiably, &ldquo;that this
      hyeh question has been discussed peaceable by civilized citizens? Now you
      sit down and be good, and Mr. Le Moyne will return your gun when we're
      across that broken bridge, if they have got it fixed for heavy trains
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This train will be lighter when it gets to that bridge,&rdquo; spoke Trampas,
      out on his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's true, too!&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;Maybe none of us are
      crossin' that Big Horn bridge now, except me. Funny if yu' should end by
      persuadin' me to quit and go to Rawhide myself! But I reckon I'll not. I
      reckon I'll worry along to Sunk Creek, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't forget I'm cookin' for yu',&rdquo; said Scipio, gruffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm obliged to yu',&rdquo; said the Southerner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were speaking of a job for me,&rdquo; said Shorty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm right obliged. But yu' see&mdash;I ain't exackly foreman the way this
      comes out, and my promises might not bind Judge Henry to pay salaries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A push came through the train from forward. We were slowing for the
      Rawhide station, and all began to be busy and to talk. &ldquo;Going up to the
      mines to-day?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, let's grub first.&rdquo; &ldquo;Guess it's too late, anyway.&rdquo; And
      so forth; while they rolled and roped their bedding, and put on their
      coats with a good deal of elbow motion, and otherwise showed off. It was
      wasted. The Virginian did not know what was going on in the caboose. He
      was leaning and looking out ahead, and Scipio's puzzled eye never left
      him. And as we halted for the water-tank, the Southerner exclaimed, &ldquo;They
      'ain't got away yet!&rdquo; as if it were good news to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He meant the delayed trains. Four stalled expresses were in front of us,
      besides several freights. And two hours more at least before the bridge
      would be ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travellers stood and sat about forlorn, near the cars, out in the
      sage-brush, anywhere. People in hats and spurs watched them, and Indian
      chiefs offered them painted bows and arrows and shiny horns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon them passengers would prefer a laig o' mutton,&rdquo; said the
      Virginian to a man loafing near the caboose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet your life!&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;First lot has been stuck here four days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plumb starved, ain't they?&rdquo; inquired the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet your life! They've eat up their dining cars and they've eat up this
      town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Virginian, looking at the town, &ldquo;I expaict the
      dining-cyars contained more nourishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, you're about right there!&rdquo; said the man. He walked beside the
      caboose as we puffed slowly forward from the water-tank to our siding.
      &ldquo;Fine business here if we'd only been ready,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;And the Crow
      agent has let his Indians come over from the reservation. There has been a
      little beef brought in, and game, and fish. And big money in it, bet your
      life! Them Eastern passengers has just been robbed. I wisht I had
      somethin' to sell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything starting for Rawhide this afternoon?&rdquo; said Trampas, out of the
      caboose door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until morning,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;You going to the mines?&rdquo; he resumed to
      the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered the Southerner, slowly and casually, and addressing
      himself strictly to the man, while Trampas, on his side, paid obvious
      inattention, &ldquo;this hyeh delay, yu' see, may unsettle our plans some. But
      it'll be one of two ways,&mdash;we're all goin' to Rawhide, or we're all
      goin' to Billings. We're all one party, yu' see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trampas laughed audibly inside the door as he rejoined his men. &ldquo;Let him
      keep up appearances,&rdquo; I heard him tell them. &ldquo;It don't hurt us what he
      says to strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm goin' to eat hearty either way,&rdquo; continued the Virginian. &ldquo;And I
      ain' goin' to be robbed. I've been kind o' promisin' myself a treat if we
      stopped hyeh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Town's eat clean out,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So yu' tell me. But all you folks has forgot one source of revenue that
      yu' have right close by, mighty handy. If you have got a gunny sack, I'll
      show you how to make some money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet your life!&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Le Moyne,&rdquo; said the Virginian, &ldquo;the outfit's cookin' stuff is aboard,
      and if you'll get the fire ready, we'll try how frawgs' laigs go fried.&rdquo;
       He walked off at once, the man following like a dog. Inside the caboose
      rose a gust of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frogs!&rdquo; muttered Scipio. And then turning a blank face to me, &ldquo;Frogs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Cyrus Jones had them on his bill of fare,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;'FROGS' LEGS
       LA DELMONICO.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shoo! I didn't get up that thing. They had it when I came. Never looked
      at it. Frogs?&rdquo; He went down the steps very slowly, with a long frown.
      Reaching the ground, he shook his head. &ldquo;That man's trail is surely hard
      to anticipate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I must hurry up that fire. For his
      appearance has given me encouragement,&rdquo; Scipio concluded, and became
      brisk. Shorty helped him, and I brought wood. Trampas and the other people
      strolled off to the station, a compact band.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our little fire was built beside the caboose, so the cooking things might
      be easily reached and put back. You would scarcely think such operations
      held any interest, even for the hungry, when there seemed to be nothing to
      cook. A few sticks blazing tamely in the dust, a frying-pan, half a tin
      bucket of lard, some water, and barren plates and knives and forks, and
      three silent men attending to them&mdash;that was all. But the travellers
      came to see. These waifs drew near us, and stood, a sad, lone, shifting
      fringe of audience; four to begin with; and then two wandered away; and
      presently one of these came back, finding it worse elsewhere. &ldquo;Supper,
      boys?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Breakfast,&rdquo; said Scipio, crossly. And no more of them
      addressed us. I heard them joylessly mention Wall Street to each other,
      and Saratoga; I even heard the name Bryn Mawr, which is near Philadelphia.
      But these fragments of home dropped in the wilderness here in Montana
      beside a freight caboose were of no interest to me now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like frogs down there, too,&rdquo; said Scipio. &ldquo;See them marshy sloos
      full of weeds?&rdquo; We took a little turn and had a sight of the Virginian
      quite active among the ponds. &ldquo;Hush! I'm getting some thoughts,&rdquo; continued
      Scipio. &ldquo;He wasn't sorry enough. Don't interrupt me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But I'd 'most caught a-hold.&rdquo; And Scipio muttered to himself again,
      &ldquo;He wasn't sorry enough.&rdquo; Presently he swore loud and brilliantly. &ldquo;Tell
      yu'!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What did he say to Trampas after that play they exchanged
      over railroad improvements and Trampas put the josh on him? Didn't he say,
      'Trampas, I thought you'd be afraid to do it?' Well, sir, Trampas had
      better have been afraid. And that's what he meant. There's where he was
      bringin' it to. Trampas made an awful bad play then. You wait. Glory, but
      he's a knowin' man! Course he wasn't sorry. I guess he had the hardest
      kind of work to look as sorry as he did. You wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait? What for? Go on, man! What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know! I don't know! Whatever hand he's been holdin' up, this is
      the show-down. He's played for a show-down here before the caboose gets
      off the bridge. Come back to the fire, or Shorty'll be leavin' it go out.
      Grow happy some, Shorty!&rdquo; he cried on arriving, and his hand cracked on
      Shorty's shoulder. &ldquo;Supper's in sight, Shorty. Food for reflection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None for the stomach?&rdquo; asked the passenger who had spoken once before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're figuring on that too,&rdquo; said Scipio. His crossness had melted
      entirely away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they're cow-boys!&rdquo; exclaimed another passenger; and he moved nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the station Trampas now came back, his herd following him less
      compactly. They had found famine, and no hope of supplies until the next
      train from the East. This was no fault of Trampas's; but they were
      following him less compactly. They carried one piece of cheese, the size
      of a fist, the weight of a brick, the hue of a corpse. And the passengers,
      seeing it, exclaimed, &ldquo;There's Old Faithful again!&rdquo; and took off their
      hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gentlemen met that cheese before, then?&rdquo; said Scipio, delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's been offered me three times a day for four days,&rdquo; said the
      passenger. &ldquo;Did he want a dollar or a dollar and a half?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two dollars!&rdquo; blurted out the enthusiast. And all of us save Trampas fell
      into fits of imbecile laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes our grub, anyway,&rdquo; said Scipio, looking off toward the
      marshes. And his hilarity sobered away in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the train will be in soon,&rdquo; stated Trampas. &ldquo;I guess we'll get a
      decent supper without frogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All interest settled now upon the Virginian. He was coming with his man
      and his gunny sack, and the gunny sack hung from his shoulder heavily, as
      a full sack should. He took no notice of the gathering, but sat down and
      partly emptied the sack. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, very businesslike, to his
      assistant, &ldquo;that's all we'll want. I think you'll find a ready market for
      the balance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my gracious!&rdquo; said the enthusiast. &ldquo;What fool eats a frog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm fool enough for a tadpole!&rdquo; cried the passenger. And they began
      to take out their pocket-books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can cook yours right hyeh, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the Virginian, with his
      slow Southern courtesy. &ldquo;The dining-cyars don't look like they were fired
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much will you sell a couple for?&rdquo; inquired the enthusiast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian looked at him with friendly surprise. &ldquo;Why, help yourself!
      We're all together yet awhile. Help yourselves,&rdquo; he repeated, to Trampas
      and his followers. These hung back a moment, then, with a slinking motion,
      set the cheese upon the earth and came forward nearer the fire to receive
      some supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't scarcely be Delmonico style,&rdquo; said the Virginian to the
      passengers, &ldquo;nor yet Saynt Augustine.&rdquo; He meant the great Augustin, the
      traditional chef of Philadelphia, whose history I had sketched for him at
      Colonel Cyrus Jones's eating palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scipio now officiated. His frying-pan was busy, and prosperous odors rose
      from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run for a bucket of fresh water, Shorty,&rdquo; the Virginian continued,
      beginning his meal. &ldquo;Colonel, yu' cook pretty near good. If yu' had sold
      'em as advertised, yu'd have cert'nly made a name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several were now eating with satisfaction, but not Scipio. It was all that
      he could do to cook straight. The whole man seemed to glisten. His eye was
      shut to a slit once more, while the innocent passengers thankfully
      swallowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you see, you have made some money,&rdquo; began the Virginian to the
      native who had helped him get the frogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet your life!&rdquo; exclaimed the man. &ldquo;Divvy, won't you?&rdquo; And he held out
      half his gains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep 'em,&rdquo; returned the Southerner. &ldquo;I reckon we're square. But I expaict
      they'll not equal Delmonico's, seh?&rdquo; he said to a passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't trust the judgment of a man as hungry as I am!&rdquo; exclaimed the
      traveller, with a laugh. And he turned to his fellow-travellers. &ldquo;Did you
      ever enjoy supper at Delmonico's more than this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; they sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, look here,&rdquo; said the traveller, &ldquo;what fools the people of this town
      are! Here we've been all these starving days, and you come and get ahead
      of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right easy explained,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;I've been where there
      was big money in frawgs, and they 'ain't been. They're all cattle hyeh.
      Talk cattle, think cattle, and they're bankrupt in consequence. Fallen
      through. Ain't that so?&rdquo; he inquired of the native.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's about the way,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's mighty hard to do what your neighbors ain't doin',&rdquo; pursued the
      Virginian. &ldquo;Montana is all cattle, an' these folks must be cattle, an'
      never notice the country right hyeh is too small for a range, an' swampy,
      anyway, an' just waitin' to be a frawg ranch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, all wore a face of careful reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not claimin' to be smarter than you folks hyeh,&rdquo; said the Virginian,
      deprecatingly, to his assistant. &ldquo;But travellin' learns a man many
      customs. You wouldn't do the business they done at Tulare, California,
      north side o' the lake. They cert'nly utilized them hopeless swamps
      splendid. Of course they put up big capital and went into it scientific,
      gettin' advice from the government Fish Commission, an' such like
      knowledge. Yu' see, they had big markets for their frawgs,&mdash;San
      Francisco, Los Angeles, and clear to New York afteh the Southern Pacific
      was through. But up hyeh yu' could sell to passengers every day like yu'
      done this one day. They would get to know yu' along the line. Competing
      swamps are scarce. The dining-cyars would take your frawgs, and yu' would
      have the Yellowstone Park for four months in the year. Them hotels are
      anxious to please, an' they would buy off yu' what their Eastern patrons
      esteem as fine-eatin'. And you folks would be sellin' something instead o'
      nothin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a practical idea,&rdquo; said a traveller. &ldquo;And little cost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And little cost,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would Eastern people eat frogs?&rdquo; inquired the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at us!&rdquo; said the traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delmonico doesn't give yu' such a treat!&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly!&rdquo; the traveller exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much would be paid for frogs?&rdquo; said Trampas to him. And I saw Scipio
      bend closer to his cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; said the traveller. &ldquo;We've paid pretty well, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're late for Tulare, Trampas,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not thinking of Tulare,&rdquo; Trampas retorted. Scipio's nose was in the
      frying-pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mos' comical spot you ever struck!&rdquo; said the Virginian, looking round
      upon the whole company. He allowed himself a broad smile of retrospect.
      &ldquo;To hear 'em talk frawgs at Tulare! Same as other folks talks hawsses or
      steers or whatever they're raising to sell. Yu'd fall into it yourselves
      if yu' started the business. Anything a man's bread and butter depends on,
      he's going to be earnest about. Don't care if it is a frawg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said the native. &ldquo;And it paid good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only money in the county was right there,&rdquo; answered the Virginian.
      &ldquo;It was a dead county, and only frawgs was movin'. But that business was
      a-fannin' to beat four of a kind. It made yu' feel strange at first, as I
      said. For all the men had been cattle-men at one time or another. Till yu'
      got accustomed, it would give 'most anybody a shock to hear 'em speak
      about herdin' the bulls in a pasture by themselves.&rdquo; The Virginian allowed
      himself another smile, but became serious again. &ldquo;That was their policy,&rdquo;
       he explained. &ldquo;Except at certain times o' year they kept the bulls
      separate. The Fish Commission told 'em they'd better, and it cert'nly
      worked mighty well. It or something did&mdash;for, gentlemen, hush! but
      there was millions. You'd have said all the frawgs in the world had taken
      charge at Tulare. And the money rolled in! Gentlemen, hush! 'twas a gold
      mine for the owners. Forty per cent they netted some years. And they paid
      generous wages. For they could sell to all them French restaurants in San
      Francisco, yu' see. And there was the Cliff House. And the Palace Hotel
      made it a specialty. And the officers took frawgs at the Presidio, an'
      Angel Island, an' Alcatraz, an' Benicia. Los Angeles was beginnin' its
      boom. The corner-lot sharps wanted something by way of varnish. An' so
      they dazzled Eastern investors with advertisin' Tulare frawgs clear to New
      Orleans an' New York. 'Twas only in Sacramento frawgs was dull. I expaict
      the California legislature was too or'n'ry for them fine-raised luxuries.
      They tell of one of them senators that he raked a million out of Los
      Angeles real estate, and started in for a bang-up meal with champagne.
      Wanted to scatter his new gold thick an' quick. But he got astray among
      all the fancy dishes, an' just yelled right out before the ladies, 'Damn
      it! bring me forty dollars' worth of ham and aiggs.' He was a funny
      senator, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian paused, and finished eating a leg. And then with diabolic
      art he made a feint at wandering to new fields of anecdote. &ldquo;Talkin' of
      senators,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;Senator Wise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much did you say wages were at Tulare?&rdquo; inquired one of the Trampas
      faction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much? Why, I never knew what the foreman got. The regular hands got a
      hundred. Senator Wise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred a MONTH?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it was wet an' muddy work, yu' see. A man risked rheumatism some. He
      risked it a good deal. Well, I was going to tell about Senator Wise. When
      Senator Wise was speaking of his visit to Alaska&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty per cent, was it?&rdquo; said Trampas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I must call my wife,&rdquo; said the traveller behind me. &ldquo;This is what I
      came West for.&rdquo; And he hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not forty per cent the bad years,&rdquo; replied the Virginian. &ldquo;The frawgs had
      enemies, same as cattle. I remember when a pelican got in the spring
      pasture, and the herd broke through the fence&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fence?&rdquo; said a passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ditch, seh, and wire net. Every pasture was a square swamp with a ditch
      around, and a wire net. Yu've heard the mournful, mixed-up sound a big
      bunch of cattle will make? Well, seh, as yu' druv from the railroad to the
      Tulare frawg ranch yu' could hear 'em a mile. Springtime they'd sing like
      girls in the organ loft, and by August they were about ready to hire out
      for bass. And all was fit to be soloists, if I'm a judge. But in a bad
      year it might only be twenty per cent. The pelican rushed 'em from the
      pasture right into the San Joaquin River, which was close by the property.
      The big balance of the herd stampeded, and though of course they came out
      on the banks again, the news had went around, and folks below at Hemlen
      eat most of 'em just to spite the company. Yu' see, a frawg in a river is
      more hopeless than any maverick loose on the range. And they never struck
      any plan to brand their stock and prove ownership.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, twenty per cent is good enough for me,&rdquo; said Trampas, &ldquo;if Rawhide
      don't suit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred a month!&rdquo; said the enthusiast. And busy calculations began to
      arise among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It went to fifty per cent,&rdquo; pursued the Virginian, &ldquo;when New York and
      Philadelphia got to biddin' agaynst each other. Both cities had signs all
      over 'em claiming to furnish the Tulare frawg. And both had 'em all right.
      And same as cattle trains, yu'd see frawg trains tearing acrosst Arizona&mdash;big
      glass tanks with wire over 'em&mdash;through to New York, an' the frawgs
      starin' out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, George,&rdquo; whispered a woman's voice behind me, &ldquo;he's merely deceiving
      them! He's merely making that stuff up out of his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear, that's merely what he's doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't see why you imagined I should care for this. I think I'll
      go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better see it out, Daisy. This beats the geysers or anything we're likely
      to find in the Yellowstone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I wish we had gone to Bar Harbor as usual,&rdquo; said the lady, and she
      returned to her Pullman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her husband stayed. Indeed, the male crowd now was a goodly sight to
      see, how the men edged close, drawn by a common tie. Their different kinds
      of feet told the strength of the bond&mdash;yellow sleeping-car slippers
      planted miscellaneous and motionless near a pair of Mexican spurs. All
      eyes watched the Virginian and gave him their entire sympathy. Though they
      could not know his motive for it, what he was doing had fallen as light
      upon them&mdash;all except the excited calculators. These were loudly
      making their fortunes at both Rawhide and Tulare, drugged by their
      satanically aroused hopes of gold, heedless of the slippers and the spurs.
      Had a man given any sign to warn them, I think he would have been lynched.
      Even the Indian chiefs had come to see in their show war bonnets and
      blankets. They naturally understood nothing of it, yet magnetically knew
      that the Virginian was the great man. And they watched him with approval.
      He sat by the fire with the frying-pan, looking his daily self&mdash;engaging
      and saturnine. And now as Trampas declared tickets to California would be
      dear and Rawhide had better come first, the Southerner let loose his
      heaven-born imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a better reason for Rawhide than tickets, Trampas,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
      said it was too late for Tulare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you,&rdquo; said Trampas. &ldquo;Opinions may differ. You and I don't think
      alike on several points.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gawd, Trampas!&rdquo; said the Virginian, &ldquo;d' yu' reckon I'd be rotting hyeh on
      forty dollars if Tulare was like it used to be? Tulare is broke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What broke it? Your leaving?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Revenge broke it, and disease,&rdquo; said the Virginian, striking the
      frying-pan on his knee, for the frogs were all gone. At those lurid words
      their untamed child minds took fire, and they drew round him again to hear
      a tale of blood. The crowd seemed to lean nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for a short moment it threatened to be spoiled. A passenger came
      along, demanding in an important voice, &ldquo;Where are these frogs?&rdquo; He was a
      prominent New York after-dinner speaker, they whispered me, and out for a
      holiday in his private car. Reaching us and walking to the Virginian, he
      said cheerily, &ldquo;How much do you want for your frogs, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got a friend hyeh?&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;That's good, for yu' need
      care taken of yu'.&rdquo; And the prominent after-dinner speaker did not further
      discommode us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's worth my trip,&rdquo; whispered a New York passenger to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was a case of revenge,&rdquo; resumed the Virginian, &ldquo;and disease.
      There was a man named Saynt Augustine got run out of Domingo, which is a
      Dago island. He come to Philadelphia, an' he was dead broke. But Saynt
      Augustine was a live man, an' he saw Philadelphia was full o' Quakers that
      dressed plain an' eat humdrum. So he started cookin' Domingo way for 'em,
      an' they caught right ahold. Terrapin, he gave 'em, an' croakeets, an'
      he'd use forty chickens to make a broth he called consommay. An' he got
      rich, and Philadelphia got well known, an' Delmonico in New York he got
      jealous. He was the cook that had the say-so in New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Delmonico one of them I-talians?&rdquo; inquired a fascinated mutineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. But he acted like one. Lorenzo was his front name. He aimed
      to cut&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Domingo's throat?&rdquo; breathed the enthusiast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aimed to cut away the trade from Saynt Augustine an' put Philadelphia
      back where he thought she belonged. Frawgs was the fashionable rage then.
      These foreign cooks set the fashion in eatin', same as foreign dressmakers
      do women's clothes. Both cities was catchin' and swallowin' all the frawgs
      Tulare could throw at 'em. So he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lorenzo?&rdquo; said the enthusiast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Lorenzo Delmonico. He bid a dollar a tank higher. An' Saynt
      Augustine raised him fifty cents. An' Lorenzo raised him a dollar. An'
      Saynt Augustine shoved her up three. Lorenzo he didn't expect Philadelphia
      would go that high, and he got hot in the collar, an' flew round his
      kitchen in New York, an' claimed he'd twist Saynt Augustine's Domingo tail
      for him and crack his ossified system. Lorenzo raised his language to a
      high temperature, they say. An' then quite sudden off he starts for
      Tulare. He buys tickets over the Santa Fe, and he goes a-fannin' and
      a-foggin'. But, gentlemen, hush! The very same day Saynt Augustine he
      tears out of Philadelphia. He travelled by the way o' Washington, an' out
      he comes a-fannin' an' a-foggin' over the Southern Pacific. Of course
      Tulare didn't know nothin' of this. All it knowed was how the frawg market
      was on soarin' wings, and it was feelin' like a flight o' rawckets. If
      only there'd been some preparation,&mdash;a telegram or something,&mdash;the
      disaster would never have occurred. But Lorenzo and Saynt Augustine was
      that absorbed watchin' each other&mdash;for, yu' see, the Santa Fe and the
      Southern Pacific come together at Mojave, an' the two cooks travelled a
      matter of two hundred an' ten miles in the same cyar&mdash;they never
      thought about a telegram. And when they arruv, breathless, an' started in
      to screechin' what they'd give for the monopoly, why, them unsuspectin'
      Tulare boys got amused at 'em. I never heard just all they done, but they
      had Lorenzo singin' and dancin', while Saynt Augustine played the fiddle
      for him. And one of Lorenzo's heels did get a trifle grazed. Well, them
      two cooks quit that ranch without disclosin' their identity, and soon as
      they got to a safe distance they swore eternal friendship, in their
      excitable foreign way. And they went home over the Union Pacific, sharing
      the same stateroom. Their revenge killed frawgs. The disease&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How killed frogs?&rdquo; demanded Trampas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just killed 'em. Delmonico and Saynt Augustine wiped frawgs off the slate
      of fashion. Not a banker in Fifth Avenue'll touch one now if another
      banker's around watchin' him. And if ever yu' see a man that hides his
      feet an' won't take off his socks in company, he has worked in them Tulare
      swamps an' got the disease. Catch him wadin', and yu'll find he's
      web-footed. Frawgs are dead, Trampas, and so are you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise up, liars, and salute your king!&rdquo; yelled Scipio. &ldquo;Oh, I'm in love
      with you!&rdquo; And he threw his arms round the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me shake hands with you,&rdquo; said the traveller, who had failed to
      interest his wife in these things. &ldquo;I wish I was going to have more of
      your company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank ye', seh,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other passengers greeted him, and the Indian chiefs came, saying, &ldquo;How!&rdquo;
       because they followed their feelings without understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't show so humbled, boys,&rdquo; said the deputy foreman to his most
      sheepish crew. &ldquo;These gentlemen from the East have been enjoying yu' some,
      I know. But think what a weary wait they have had hyeh. And you insisted
      on playing the game with me this way, yu' see. What outlet did yu' give
      me? Didn't I have it to do? And I'll tell yu' one thing for your
      consolation: when I got to the middle of the frawgs I 'most believed it
      myself.&rdquo; And he laughed out the first laugh I had heard him give.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enthusiast came up and shook hands. That led off, and the rest
      followed, with Trampas at the end. The tide was too strong for him. He was
      not a graceful loser; but he got through this, and the Virginian eased him
      down by treating him precisely like the others&mdash;apparently. Possibly
      the supreme&mdash;the most American&mdash;moment of all was when word came
      that the bridge was open, and the Pullman trains, with noise and triumph,
      began to move westward at last. Every one waved farewell to every one,
      craning from steps and windows, so that the cars twinkled with hilarity;
      and in twenty minutes the whole procession in front had moved, and our
      turn came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last chance for Rawhide,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last chance for Sunk Creek,&rdquo; said a reconstructed mutineer, and all
      sprang aboard. There was no question who had won his spurs now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our caboose trundled on to Billings along the shingly cotton-wooded
      Yellowstone; and as the plains and bluffs and the distant snow began to
      grow well known, even to me, we turned to our baggage that was to come
      off, since camp would begin in the morning. Thus I saw the Virginian
      carefully rewrapping Kenilworth, that he might bring it to its owner
      unharmed; and I said, &ldquo;Don't you think you could have played poker with
      Queen Elizabeth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I expaict she'd have beat me,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;She was a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at Billings, on this day, that I made those reflections about
      equality. For the Virginian had been equal to the occasion: that is the
      only kind of equality which I recognize.

    <h2>
      XVII. SCIPIO MORALIZES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Into what mood was it that the Virginian now fell? Being less busy, did he
      begin to &ldquo;grieve&rdquo; about the girl on Bear Creek? I only know that after
      talking so lengthily he fell into a nine days' silence. The talking part
      of him deeply and unbrokenly slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Official words of course came from him as we rode southward from the
      railroad, gathering the Judge's stray cattle. During the many weeks since
      the spring round-up, some of these animals had as usual got very far off
      their range, and getting them on again became the present business of our
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directions and commands&mdash;whatever communications to his subordinates
      were needful to the forwarding of this&mdash;he duly gave. But routine has
      never at any time of the world passed for conversation. His utterances,
      such as, &ldquo;We'll work Willo' Creek to-morro' mawnin',&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I want the
      wagon to be at the fawks o' Stinkin' Water by Thursday,&rdquo; though on some
      occasions numerous enough to sound like discourse, never once broke the
      man's true silence. Seeming to keep easy company with the camp, he yet
      kept altogether to himself. That talking part of him&mdash;the mood which
      brings out for you your friend's spirit and mind as a free gift or as an
      exchange&mdash;was down in some dark cave of his nature, hidden away.
      Perhaps it had been dreaming; perhaps completely reposing. The Virginian
      was one of those rare ones who are able to refresh themselves in sections.
      To have a thing on his mind did not keep his body from resting. During our
      recent journey&mdash;it felt years ago now!&mdash;while our caboose on the
      freight train had trundled endlessly westward, and the men were on the
      ragged edge, the very jumping-off place, of mutiny and possible murder, I
      had seen him sleep like a child. He snatched the moments not necessary for
      vigil. I had also seen him sit all night watching his responsibility,
      ready to spring on it and fasten his teeth in it. And now that he had
      confounded them with their own attempted weapon of ridicule, his powers
      seemed to be profoundly dormant. That final pitched battle of wits had
      made the men his captives and admirers&mdash;all save Trampas. And of him
      the Virginian did not seem to be aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Scipio le Moyne would say to me now and then, &ldquo;If I was Trampas, I'd
      pull my freight.&rdquo; And once he added, &ldquo;Pull it kind of casual, yu' know,
      like I wasn't noticing myself do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; our friend Shorty murmured pregnantly, with his eye upon the quiet
      Virginian, &ldquo;he's sure studying his revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Studying your pussy-cat,&rdquo; said Scipio. &ldquo;He knows what he'll do. The time
      ain't arrived.&rdquo; This was the way they felt about it; and not unnaturally
      this was the way they made me, the inexperienced Easterner, feel about it.
      That Trampas also felt something about it was easy to know. Like the
      leaven which leavens the whole lump, one spot of sulkiness in camp will
      spread its dull flavor through any company that sits near it; and we had
      to sit near Trampas at meals for nine days.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sullenness was not wonderful. To feel himself forsaken by his recent
      adherents, to see them gone over to his enemy, could not have made his
      reflections pleasant. Why he did not take himself off to other climes&mdash;&ldquo;pull
      his freight casual,&rdquo; as Scipio said&mdash;I can explain only thus: pay was
      due him&mdash;&ldquo;time,&rdquo; as it was called in cow-land; if he would have this
      money, he must stay under the Virginian's command until the Judge's ranch
      on Sunk Creek should be reached; meanwhile, each day's work added to the
      wages in store for him; and finally, once at Sunk Creek, it would be no
      more the Virginian who commanded him; it would be the real ranch foreman.
      At the ranch he would be the Virginian's equal again, both of them taking
      orders from their officially recognized superior, this foreman. Shorty's
      word about &ldquo;revenge&rdquo; seemed to me like putting the thing backwards.
      Revenge, as I told Scipio, was what I should be thinking about if I were
      Trampas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He dassent,&rdquo; was Scipio's immediate view. &ldquo;Not till he's got strong
      again. He got laughed plumb sick by the bystanders, and whatever spirit he
      had was broke in the presence of us all. He'll have to recuperate.&rdquo; Scipio
      then spoke of the Virginian's attitude. &ldquo;Maybe revenge ain't just the
      right word for where this affair has got to now with him. When yu' beat
      another man at his own game like he done to Trampas, why, yu've had all
      the revenge yu' can want, unless you're a hog. And he's no hog. But he has
      got it in for Trampas. They've not reckoned to a finish. Would you let a
      man try such spite-work on you and quit thinkin' about him just because
      yu'd headed him off?&rdquo; To this I offered his own notion about hogs and
      being satisfied. &ldquo;Hogs!&rdquo; went on Scipio, in a way that dashed my
      suggestion to pieces; &ldquo;hogs ain't in the case. He's got to deal with
      Trampas somehow&mdash;man to man. Trampas and him can't stay this way when
      they get back and go workin' same as they worked before. No, sir; I've
      seen his eye twice, and I know he's goin' to reckon to a finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I still must, in Scipio's opinion, have been slow to understand, when on
      the afternoon following this talk I invited him to tell me what sort of
      &ldquo;finish&rdquo; he wanted, after such a finishing as had been dealt Trampas
      already. Getting &ldquo;laughed plumb sick by the bystanders&rdquo; (I borrowed his
      own not overstated expression) seemed to me a highly final finishing.
      While I was running my notions off to him, Scipio rose, and, with the
      frying-pan he had been washing, walked slowly at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe you'd oughtn't to be let travel alone the way you do.&rdquo; He
      put his face close to mine. His long nose grew eloquent in its shrewdness,
      while the fire in his bleached blue eye burned with amiable satire. &ldquo;What
      has come and gone between them two has only settled the one point he was
      aimin' to make. He was appointed boss of this outfit in the absence of the
      regular foreman. Since then all he has been playin' for is to hand back
      his men to the ranch in as good shape as they'd been handed to him, and
      without losing any on the road through desertion or shooting or what not.
      He had to kick his cook off the train that day, and the loss made him
      sorrowful, I could see. But I'd happened to come along, and he jumped me
      into the vacancy, and I expect he is pretty near consoled. And as boss of
      the outfit he beat Trampas, who was settin' up for opposition boss. And
      the outfit is better than satisfied it come out that way, and they're
      stayin' with him; and he'll hand them all back in good condition, barrin'
      that lost cook. So for the present his point is made, yu' see. But look
      ahead a little. It may not be so very far ahead yu'll have to look. We get
      back to the ranch. He's not boss there any more. His responsibility is
      over. He is just one of us again, taking orders from a foreman they tell
      me has showed partiality to Trampas more'n a few times. Partiality! That's
      what Trampas is plainly trusting to. Trusting it will fix him all right
      and fix his enemy all wrong. He'd not otherwise dare to keep sour like
      he's doing. Partiality! D' yu' think it'll scare off the enemy?&rdquo; Scipio
      looked across a little creek to where the Virginian was helping throw the
      gathered cattle on the bedground. &ldquo;What odds&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed the
      frying-pan at the Southerner&mdash;&ldquo;d' yu' figure Trampas's being under
      any foreman's wing will make to a man like him? He's going to remember Mr.
      Trampas and his spite-work if he's got to tear him out from under the
      wing, and maybe tear off the wing in the operation. And I am goin' to
      advise your folks,&rdquo; ended the complete Scipio, &ldquo;not to leave you travel so
      much alone&mdash;not till you've learned more life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had made me feel my inexperience, convinced me of innocence,
      undoubtedly; and during the final days of our journey I no longer invoked
      his aid to my reflections upon this especial topic: What would the
      Virginian do to Trampas? Would it be another intellectual crushing of him,
      like the frog story, or would there be something this time more material&mdash;say
      muscle, or possibly gunpowder&mdash;in it? And was Scipio, after all,
      infallible? I didn't pretend to understand the Virginian; after several
      years' knowledge of him he remained utterly beyond me. Scipio's experience
      was not yet three weeks long. So I let him alone as to all this,
      discussing with him most other things good and evil in the world, and
      being convinced of much further innocence; for Scipio's twenty odd years
      were indeed a library of life. I have never met a better heart, a shrewder
      wit, and looser morals, with yet a native sense of decency and duty
      somewhere hard and fast enshrined.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all the while I was wondering about the Virginian: eating with him,
      sleeping with him (only not so sound as he did), and riding beside him
      often for many hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experiments in conversation I did make&mdash;and failed. One day
      particularly while, after a sudden storm of hail had chilled the earth
      numb and white like winter in fifteen minutes, we sat drying and warming
      ourselves by a fire that we built, I touched upon that theme of equality
      on which I knew him to hold opinions as strong as mine. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he would
      reply, and &ldquo;Cert'nly&rdquo;; and when I asked him what it was in a man that made
      him a leader of men, he shook his head and puffed his pipe. So then,
      noticing how the sun had brought the earth in half an hour back from
      winter to summer again, I spoke of our American climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a potent drug, I said, for millions to be swallowing every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, wiping the damp from his Winchester rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our American climate, I said, had worked remarkable changes, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; and did not ask what they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I had to tell him. &ldquo;It has made successful politicians of the Irish.
      That's one. And it has given our whole race the habit of poker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bang went his Winchester. The bullet struck close to my left. I sat up
      angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the first foolish thing I ever saw you do!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he drawled slowly, &ldquo;I'd ought to have done it sooner. He was pretty
      near lively again.&rdquo; And then he picked up a rattlesnake six feet behind
      me. It had been numbed by the hail, part revived by the sun, and he had
      shot its head off.

    <h2>
      XVIII. &ldquo;WOULD YOU BE A PARSON?&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      After this I gave up my experiments in conversation. So that by the final
      afternoon of our journey, with Sunk Creek actually in sight, and the great
      grasshoppers slatting their dry song over the sage-brush, and the time at
      hand when the Virginian and Trampas would be &ldquo;man to man,&rdquo; my thoughts
      rose to a considerable pitch of speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that talking part of the Virginian, which had been nine days
      asleep, gave its first yawn and stretch of waking. Without preface, he
      suddenly asked me, &ldquo;Would you be a parson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was mentally so far away that I couldn't get back in time to comprehend
      or answer before he had repeated: &ldquo;What would yu' take to be a parson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drawled it out in his gentle way, precisely as if no nine days stood
      between it and our last real intercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take?&rdquo; I was still vaguely moving in my distance. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His next question brought me home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect the Pope's is the biggest of them parson jobs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with an &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; that I now entirely took his idea. &ldquo;Well, yes;
      decidedly the biggest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beats the English one? Archbishop&mdash;ain't it?&mdash;of Canterbury?
      The Pope comes ahead of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Holiness would say so if his Grace did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian turned half in his saddle to see my face&mdash;I was, at the
      moment, riding not quite abreast of him&mdash;and I saw the gleam of his
      teeth beneath his mustache. It was seldom I could make him smile, even to
      this slight extent. But his eyes grew, with his next words, remote again
      in their speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Holiness and his Grace. Now if I was to hear 'em namin' me that-a-way
      every mawnin', I'd sca'cely get down to business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you'd get used to the pride of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tisn't the pride. The laugh is what would ruin me. 'Twould take 'most
      all my attention keeping a straight face. The Archbishop&rdquo;&mdash;here he
      took one of his wide mental turns&mdash;&ldquo;is apt to be a big man in them
      Shakespeare plays. Kings take talk from him they'd not stand from anybody
      else; and he talks fine, frequently. About the bees, for instance, when
      Henry is going to fight France. He tells him a beehive is similar to a
      kingdom. I learned that piece.&rdquo; The Virginian could not have expected to
      blush at uttering these last words. He knew that his sudden color must
      tell me in whose book it was he had learned the piece. Was not her copy of
      Kenilworth even now in his cherishing pocket? So he now, to cover his
      blush, very deliberately recited to me the Archbishop's discourse upon
      bees and their kingdom:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'Where some, like magistrates, correct at home...
      Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
      Make loot upon the summer's velvet buds;
      Which pillage they with merry march bring home
      To the tent-royal of their emperor:
      He, busied in his majesty, surveys
      The singing masons building roofs of gold.'
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't that a fine description of bees a-workin'? 'The singing masons
      building roofs of gold!' Puts 'em right before yu', and is poetry without
      bein' foolish. His Holiness and his Grace. Well, they could not hire me
      for either o' those positions. How many religions are there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All over the earth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yu' can begin with ourselves. Right hyeh at home I know there's
      Romanists, and Episcopals&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two kinds!&rdquo; I put in. &ldquo;At least two of Episcopals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's three. Then Methodists and Baptists, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three Methodists!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you do the countin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I accordingly did it, feeling my revolving memory slip cogs all the way
      round. &ldquo;Anyhow, there are safely fifteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen.&rdquo; He held this fact a moment. &ldquo;And they don't worship a whole
      heap o' different gods like the ancients did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's just the same one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian folded his hands over the horn of his saddle, and leaned
      forward upon them in contemplation of the wide, beautiful landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One God and fifteen religions,&rdquo; was his reflection. &ldquo;That's a right smart
      of religions for just one God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This way of reducing it was, if obvious to him, so novel to me that my
      laugh evidently struck him as a louder and livelier comment than was
      required. He turned on me as if I had somehow perverted the spirit of his
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't religious. I know that. But I ain't unreligious. And I know that
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I know it, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think there ought to be fifteen varieties of good people?&rdquo; His
      voice, while it now had an edge that could cut anything it came against,
      was still not raised. &ldquo;There ain't fifteen. There ain't two. There's one
      kind. And when I meet it, I respect it. It is not praying nor preaching
      that has ever caught me and made me ashamed of myself, but one or two
      people I have knowed that never said a superior word to me. They thought
      more o' me than I deserved, and that made me behave better than I
      naturally wanted to. Made me quit a girl onced in time for her not to lose
      her good name. And so that's one thing I have never done. And if ever I
      was to have a son or somebody I set store by, I would wish their lot to be
      to know one or two good folks mighty well&mdash;men or women&mdash;women
      preferred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had looked away again to the hills behind Sunk Creek ranch, to which
      our walking horses had now almost brought us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for parsons &ldquo;&mdash;the gesture of his arm was a disclaiming one&mdash;&ldquo;I
      reckon some parsons have a right to tell yu' to be good. The bishop of
      this hyeh Territory has a right. But I'll tell yu' this: a middlin' doctor
      is a pore thing, and a middlin' lawyer is a pore thing; but keep me from a
      middlin' man of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once again he had reduced it, but I did not laugh this time. I thought
      there should in truth be heavy damages for malpractice on human souls. But
      the hot glow of his words, and the vision of his deepest inner man it
      revealed, faded away abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do yu' make of the proposition yondeh?&rdquo; As he pointed to the cause
      of this question he had become again his daily, engaging, saturnine self.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I saw over in a fenced meadow, to which we were now close, what he
      was pleased to call &ldquo;the proposition.&rdquo; Proposition in the West does, in
      fact, mean whatever you at the moment please,&mdash;an offer to sell you a
      mine, a cloud-burst, a glass of whiskey, a steamboat. This time it meant a
      stranger clad in black, and of a clerical deportment which would in that
      atmosphere and to a watchful eye be visible for a mile or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckoned yu' hadn't noticed him,&rdquo; was the Virginian's reply to my
      ejaculation. &ldquo;Yes. He set me goin' on the subject a while back. I expect
      he is another missionary to us pore cow-boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I seemed from a hundred yards to feel the stranger's forceful personality.
      It was in his walk&mdash;I should better say stalk&mdash;as he promenaded
      along the creek. His hands were behind his back, and there was an air of
      waiting, of displeased waiting, in his movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he'll be a missionary,&rdquo; said the Virginian, conclusively; and he
      took to singing, or rather to whining, with his head tilted at an absurd
      angle upward at the sky:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'Dar is a big Car'lina nigger,
      About de size of dis chile or p'raps a little bigger,
      By de name of Jim Crow.
      Dat what de white folks call him.
      If ever I sees him I 'tends for to maul him,
      Just to let de white folks see
      Such an animos as he
      Can't walk around the streets and scandalize me.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The lane which was conducting us to the group of ranch buildings now
      turned a corner of the meadow, and the Virginian went on with his second
      verse:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;'Great big fool, he hasn't any knowledge.
    Gosh! how could he, when he's never been to scollege?
    Neither has I.
    But I'se come mighty nigh;
    I peaked through de door as I went by.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He was beginning a third stanza, but stopped short; a horse had neighed
      close behind us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trampas,&rdquo; said he, without turning his head, &ldquo;we are home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks that way.&rdquo; Some ten yards were between ourselves and Trampas,
      where he followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll trouble yu' for my rope yu' took this mawnin' instead o' your
      own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know as it's your rope I've got.&rdquo; Trampas skilfully spoke this so
      that a precisely opposite meaning flowed from his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it was discussion he tried for, he failed. The Virginian's hand moved,
      and for one thick, flashing moment my thoughts were evidently also the
      thoughts of Trampas. But the Virginian only held out to Trampas the rope
      which he had detached from his saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your hand off your gun, Trampas. If I had wanted to kill yu' you'd
      be lying nine days back on the road now. Here's your rope. Did yu' expect
      I'd not know it? It's the only one in camp the stiffness ain't all drug
      out of yet. Or maybe yu' expected me to notice and&mdash;not take notice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't spend my time in expectations about you. If&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian wheeled his horse across the road. &ldquo;Yu're talkin' too soon
      after reachin' safety, Trampas. I didn't tell yu' to hand me that rope
      this mawnin', because I was busy. I ain't foreman now; and I want that
      rope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trampas produced a smile as skilful as his voice. &ldquo;Well, I guess your
      having mine proves this one is yours.&rdquo; He rode up and received the coil
      which the Virginian held out, unloosing the disputed one on his saddle. If
      he had meant to devise a slippery, evasive insult, no small trick in
      cow-land could be more offensive than this taking another man's rope. And
      it is the small tricks which lead to the big bullets. Trampas put a smooth
      coating of plausibility over the whole transaction. &ldquo;After the rope corral
      we had to make this morning&rdquo;&mdash;his tone was mock explanatory&mdash;&ldquo;the
      ropes was all strewed round camp, and in the hustle I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said a sonorous voice behind us, &ldquo;do you happen to have seen
      Judge Henry?&rdquo; It was the reverend gentleman in his meadow, come to the
      fence. As we turned round to him he spoke on, with much rotund authority
      in his eye. &ldquo;From his answer to my letter, Judge Henry undoubtedly expects
      me here. I have arrived from Fetterman according to my plan which I
      announced to him, to find that he has been absent all day&mdash;absent the
      whole day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian sat sidewise to talk, one long, straight leg supporting him
      on one stirrup, the other bent at ease, the boot half lifted from its
      dangling stirrup. He made himself the perfection of courtesy. &ldquo;The Judge
      is frequently absent all night, seh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely to-night, I think. I thought you might know something about
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been absent myself, seh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! On a vacation, perhaps?&rdquo; The divine had a ruddy facet. His strong
      glance was straight and frank and fearless; but his smile too much
      reminded me of days bygone, when we used to return to school from the
      Christmas holidays, and the masters would shake our hands and welcome us
      with: &ldquo;Robert, John, Edward, glad to see you all looking so well! Rested,
      and ready for hard work, I'm sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That smile does not really please even good, tame little boys; and the
      Virginian was nearing thirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has not been vacation this trip, seh,&rdquo; said he, settling straight in
      his saddle. &ldquo;There's the Judge driving in now, in time for all questions
      yu' have to ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His horse took a step, but was stopped short. There lay the Virginian's
      rope on the ground. I had been aware of Trampas's quite proper departure
      during the talk; and as he was leaving, I seemed also to be aware of his
      placing the coil across the cantle of its owner's saddle. Had he intended
      it to fall and have to be picked up? It was another evasive little
      business, and quite successful, if designed to nag the owner of the rope.
      A few hundred yards ahead of us Trampas was now shouting loud cow-boy
      shouts. Were they to announce his return to those at home, or did they
      mean derision? The Virginian leaned, keeping his seat, and, swinging down
      his arm, caught up the rope, and hung it on his saddle somewhat carefully.
      But the hue of rage spread over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his fence the divine now spoke, in approbation, but with another
      strong, cheerless smile. &ldquo;You pick up that rope as if you were well
      trained to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's part of our business, seh, and we try to mind it like the rest.&rdquo; But
      this, stated in a gentle drawl, did not pierce the missionary's armor; his
      superiority was very thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now rode on, and I was impressed by the reverend gentleman's robust,
      dictatorial back as he proceeded by a short cut through the meadow to the
      ranch. You could take him for nothing but a vigorous, sincere, dominating
      man, full of the highest purpose. But whatever his creed, I already
      doubted if he were the right one to sow it and make it grow in these new,
      wild fields. He seemed more the sort of gardener to keep old walks and
      vines pruned in their antique rigidity. I admired him for coming all this
      way with his clean, short, gray whiskers and his black, well-brushed suit.
      And he made me think of a powerful locomotive stuck puffing on a grade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the Virginian rode beside me, so silent in his volcanic wrath
      that I did not perceive it. The missionary coming on top of Trampas had
      been more than he could stand. But I did not know, and I spoke with
      innocent cheeriness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the parson going to save us?&rdquo; I asked; and I fairly jumped at his
      voice: &ldquo;Don't talk so much!&rdquo; he burst out. I had got the whole
      accumulation!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's been talking?&rdquo; I in equal anger screeched back. &ldquo;I'm not trying to
      save you. I didn't take your rope.&rdquo; And having poured this out, I whipped
      up my pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he spurred his own alongside of me; and glancing at him, I saw that he
      was now convulsed with internal mirth. I therefore drew down to a walk,
      and he straightened into gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm right obliged to yu',&rdquo; he laid his hand in its buckskin gauntlet upon
      my horse's mane as he spoke, &ldquo;for bringing me back out o' my nonsense.
      I'll be as serene as a bird now&mdash;whatever they do. A man,&rdquo; he stated
      reflectively, &ldquo;any full-sized man, ought to own a big lot of temper. And
      like all his valuable possessions, he'd ought to keep it and not lose
      any.&rdquo; This was his full apology. &ldquo;As for salvation, I have got this far:
      somebody,&rdquo; he swept an arm at the sunset and the mountains, &ldquo;must have
      made all that, I know. But I know one more thing I would tell Him to His
      face: if I can't do nothing long enough and good enough to earn eternal
      happiness, I can't do nothing long enough and bad enough to be damned. I
      reckon He plays a square game with us if He plays at all, and I ain't
      bothering my haid about other worlds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we reached the stables, he had become the serene bird he promised, and
      was sentimentally continuing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'De sun is made of mud from de bottom of de river;
     De moon is made o' fox-fire, as you might disciver;
     De stars like de ladies' eyes,
     All round de world dey flies,
     To give a little light when de moon don't rise.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      If words were meant to conceal our thoughts, melody is perhaps a still
      thicker veil for them. Whatever temper he had lost, he had certainly found
      again; but this all the more fitted him to deal with Trampas, when the
      dealing should begin. I had half a mind to speak to the Judge, only it
      seemed beyond a mere visitor's business. Our missionary was at this moment
      himself speaking to Judge Henry at the door of the home ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon he's explaining he has been a-waiting.&rdquo; The Virginian was
      throwing his saddle off as I loosened the cinches of mine. &ldquo;And the Judge
      don't look like he was hopelessly distressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I now surveyed the distant parley, and the Judge, from the wagonful of
      guests whom he had evidently been driving upon a day's excursion, waved me
      a welcome, which I waved back. &ldquo;He's got Miss Molly Wood there!&rdquo; I
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The Virginian was brief about this fact. &ldquo;I'll look afteh your
      saddle. You go and get acquainted with the company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This favor I accepted; it was the means he chose for saying he hoped,
      after our recent boiling over, that all was now more than right between
      us. So for the while I left him to his horses, and his corrals, and his
      Trampas, and his foreman, and his imminent problem.

    <h2>
      XIX. DR. MACBRIDE BEGS PARDON
    </h2>
    <p>
      Judge and Mrs. Henry, Molly Wood, and two strangers, a lady and a
      gentleman, were the party which had been driving in the large three-seated
      wagon. They had seemed a merry party. But as I came within hearing of
      their talk, it was a fragment of the minister's sonority which reached me
      first: &ldquo;&mdash;more opportunity for them to have the benefit of hearing
      frequent sermons,&rdquo; was the sentence I heard him bring to completion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure, sir.&rdquo; Judge Henry gave me (it almost seemed) additional
      warmth of welcome for arriving to break up the present discourse. &ldquo;Let me
      introduce you to the Rev. Dr. Alexander MacBride. Doctor, another guest we
      have been hoping for about this time,&rdquo; was my host's cordial explanation
      to him of me. There remained the gentleman with his wife from New York,
      and to these I made my final bows. But I had not broken up the discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may be said to have met already.&rdquo; Dr. MacBride had fixed upon me his
      full, mastering eye; and it occurred to me that if they had policemen in
      heaven, he would be at least a centurion in the force. But he did not mean
      to be unpleasant; it was only that in a mind full of matters less worldly,
      pleasure was left out. &ldquo;I observed your friend was a skilful horseman,&rdquo; he
      continued. &ldquo;I was saying to Judge Henry that I could wish such skilful
      horsemen might ride to a church upon the Sabbath. A church, that is, of
      right doctrine, where they would have opportunity to hear frequent
      sermons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Judge Henry, &ldquo;yes. It would be a good thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Henry, with some murmur about the kitchen, here went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was informed,&rdquo; Dr. MacBride held the rest of us, &ldquo;before undertaking my
      journey that I should find a desolate and mainly godless country. But
      nobody gave me to understand that from Medicine Bow I was to drive three
      hundred miles and pass no church of any faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge explained that there had been a few a long way to the right and
      left of him. &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he conceded, &ldquo;you are quite right. But don't forget
      that this is the newest part of a new world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge,&rdquo; said his wife, coming to the door, &ldquo;how can you keep them
      standing in the dust with your talking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This most efficiently did break up the discourse. As our little party,
      with the smiles and the polite holdings back of new acquaintanceship,
      moved into the house, the Judge detained me behind all of them long enough
      to whisper dolorously, &ldquo;He's going to stay a whole week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had hopes that he would not stay a whole week when I presently learned
      of the crowded arrangements which our hosts, with many hospitable
      apologies, disclosed to us. They were delighted to have us, but they
      hadn't foreseen that we should all be simultaneous. The foreman's house
      had been prepared for two of us, and did we mind? The two of us were Dr.
      MacBride and myself; and I expected him to mind. But I wronged him
      grossly. It would be much better, he assured Mrs. Henry, than straw in a
      stable, which he had tried several times, and was quite ready for. So I
      saw that though he kept his vigorous body clean when he could, he cared
      nothing for it in the face of his mission. How the foreman and his wife
      relished being turned out during a week for a missionary and myself was
      not my concern, although while he and I made ready for supper over there,
      it struck me as hard on them. The room with its two cots and furniture was
      as nice as possible; and we closed the door upon the adjoining room,
      which, however, seemed also untenanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Henry gave us a meal so good that I have remembered it, and her
      husband the Judge strove his best that we should eat it in merriment. He
      poured out his anecdotes like wine, and we should have quickly warmed to
      them; but Dr. MacBride sat among us, giving occasional heavy ha-ha's,
      which produced, as Miss Molly Wood whispered to me, a &ldquo;dreadfully
      cavernous effect.&rdquo; Was it his sermon, we wondered, that he was thinking
      over? I told her of the copious sheaf of them I had seen him pull from his
      wallet over at the foreman's. &ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Then are we to hear
      one every evening?&rdquo; This I doubted; he had probably been picking one out
      suitable for the occasion. &ldquo;Putting his best foot foremost,&rdquo; was her
      comment; &ldquo;I suppose they have best feet, like the rest of us.&rdquo; Then she
      grew delightfully sharp. &ldquo;Do you know, when I first heard him I thought
      his voice was hearty. But if you listen, you'll find it's merely militant.
      He never really meets you with it. He's off on his hill watching the
      battle-field the whole time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will find a hardened pagan here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! The wild man you're taming brought you Kenilworth safe back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was smooth. &ldquo;Oh, as for taming him! But don't you find him
      intelligent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly I somehow knew that she didn't want to tame him. But what did she
      want to do? The thought of her had made him blush this afternoon. No
      thought of him made her blush this evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great laugh from the rest of the company made me aware that the Judge
      had consummated his tale of the &ldquo;Sole Survivor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he finished, &ldquo;they all went off as mad as hops because it hadn't
      been a massacre.&rdquo; Mr. and Mrs. Ogden&mdash;they were the New Yorkers&mdash;gave
      this story much applause, and Dr. MacBride half a minute later laid his
      &ldquo;ha-ha,&rdquo; like a heavy stone, upon the gayety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll never be able to stand seven sermons,&rdquo; said Miss Wood to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking of massacres,&rdquo;&mdash;I now hastened to address the already
      saddened table,&mdash;&ldquo;I have recently escaped one myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge had come to an end of his powers. &ldquo;Oh, tell us!&rdquo; he implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seriously, sir, I think we grazed pretty wet tragedy but your
      extraordinary man brought us out into comedy safe and dry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This gave me their attention; and, from that afternoon in Dakota when I
      had first stepped aboard the caboose, I told them the whole tale of my
      experience: how I grew immediately aware that all was not right, by the
      Virginian's kicking the cook off the train; how, as we journeyed, the dark
      bubble of mutiny swelled hourly beneath my eyes; and how, when it was
      threatening I know not what explosion, the Virginian had pricked it with
      humor, so that it burst in nothing but harmless laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes followed my narrative: the New Yorkers, because such events do
      not happen upon the shores of the Hudson; Mrs. Henry, because she was my
      hostess; Miss Wood followed for whatever her reasons were&mdash;I couldn't
      see her eyes; rather, I FELT her listening intently to the deeds and
      dangers of the man she didn't care to tame. But it was the eyes of the
      Judge and the missionary which I saw riveted upon me indeed until the end;
      and they forthwith made plain their quite dissimilar opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Henry struck the table lightly with his fist. &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; And he
      leaned back in his chair with a face of contentment. He had trusted his
      man, and his man had proved worthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me.&rdquo; Dr. MacBride had a manner of saying &ldquo;pardon me,&rdquo; which
      rendered forgiveness well-nigh impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge waited for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand that these&mdash;a&mdash;cow-boys attempted to mutiny,
      and were discouraged in this attempt upon finding themselves less skilful
      at lying than the man they had plotted to depose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I began an answer. &ldquo;It was other qualities, sir, that happened to be
      revealed and asserted by what you call his lying that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what am I to call it, if it is not lying? A competition in deceit in
      which, I admit, he out did them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's their way to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me. Their way to lie? They bow down to the greatest in this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Miss Wood in my ear, &ldquo;give him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge took a turn. &ldquo;We-ell, Doctor&mdash;&rdquo; He seemed to stick here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ogden handsomely assisted him. &ldquo;You've said the word yourself, Doctor.
      It's the competition, don't you see? The trial of strength by no matter
      what test.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Wood, unexpectedly. &ldquo;And it wasn't that George Washington
      couldn't tell a lie. He just wouldn't. I'm sure if he'd undertaken to he'd
      have told a much better one than Cornwall's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha-ha, madam! You draw an ingenious subtlety from your books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all plain to me,&rdquo; Ogden pursued. &ldquo;The men were morose. This foreman
      was in the minority. He cajoled them into a bout of tall stories, and told
      the tallest himself. And when they found they had swallowed it whole&mdash;well,
      it would certainly take the starch out of me,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;I couldn't
      be a serious mutineer after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. MacBride now sounded his strongest bass. &ldquo;Pardon me. I cannot accept
      such a view, sir. There is a levity abroad in our land which I must
      deplore. No matter how leniently you may try to put it, in the end we have
      the spectacle of a struggle between men where lying decides the survival
      of the fittest. Better, far better, if it was to come, that they had shot
      honest bullets. There are worse evils than war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor's eye glared righteously about him. None of us, I think,
      trembled; or, if we did, it was with emotions other than fear. Mrs. Henry
      at once introduced the subject of trout-fishing, and thus happily removed
      us from the edge of whatever sort of precipice we seemed to have
      approached; for Dr. MacBride had brought his rod. He dilated upon this
      sport with fervor, and we assured him that the streams upon the west slope
      of the Bow Leg Mountains would afford him plenty of it. Thus we ended our
      meal in carefully preserved amity.

    <h2>
      XX. THE JUDGE IGNORES PARTICULARS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you often have these visitations?&rdquo; Ogden inquired of Judge Henry. Our
      host was giving us whiskey in his office, and Dr. MacBride, while we
      smoked apart from the ladies, had repaired to his quarters in the
      foreman's house previous to the service which he was shortly to hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge laughed. &ldquo;They come now and then through the year. I like the
      bishop to come. And the men always like it. But I fear our friend will
      scarcely please them so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean they'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. They'll keep quiet. The fact is, they have a good deal better
      manners than he has, if he only knew it. They'll be able to bear him. But
      as for any good he'll do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if he knows a word of science,&rdquo; said I, musing about the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Science! He doesn't know what Christianity is yet. I've entertained many
      guests, but none&mdash;The whole secret,&rdquo; broke off Judge Henry, &ldquo;lies in
      the way you treat people. As soon as you treat men as your brothers, they
      are ready to acknowledge you&mdash;if you deserve it&mdash;as their
      superior. That's the whole bottom of Christianity, and that's what our
      missionary will never know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a somewhat heavy knock at the office door, and I think we all
      feared it was Dr. MacBride. But when the Judge opened, the Virginian was
      standing there in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; The Judge opened the door wide. He was very hearty to the man he had
      trusted. &ldquo;You're back at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to repawt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While they shook hands, Ogden nudged me. &ldquo;That the fellow?&rdquo; I nodded.
      &ldquo;Fellow who kicked the cook off the train?&rdquo; I again nodded, and he looked
      at the Virginian, his eye and his stature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Henry, properly democratic, now introduced him to Ogden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Yorker also meant to be properly democratic. &ldquo;You're the man I've
      been hearing such a lot about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But familiarity is not equality. &ldquo;Then I expect yu' have the advantage of
      me, seh,&rdquo; said the Virginian, very politely. &ldquo;Shall I repawt to-morro'?&rdquo;
       His grave eyes were on the Judge again. Of me he had taken no notice; he
      had come as an employee to see his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I'll want to hear about the cattle to-morrow. But step inside a
      moment now. There's a matter&mdash;&rdquo; The Virginian stepped inside, and
      took off his hat. &ldquo;Sit down. You had trouble&mdash;I've heard something
      about it,&rdquo; the Judge went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian sat down, grave and graceful. But he held the brim of his
      hat all the while. He looked at Ogden and me, and then back at his
      employer. There was reluctance in his eye. I wondered if his employer
      could be going to make him tell his own exploits in the presence of us
      outsiders; and there came into my memory the Bengal tiger at a
      trained-animal show I had once seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had some trouble,&rdquo; repeated the Judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there was a time when they maybe wanted to have notions. They're
      good boys.&rdquo; And he smiled a very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contentment increased in the Judge's face. &ldquo;Trampas a good boy too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this time the Bengal tiger did not smile. He sat with his eye fastened
      on his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge passed rather quickly on to his next point. &ldquo;You've brought them
      all back, though, I understand, safe and sound, without a scratch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian looked down at his hat, then up again at the Judge, mildly.
      &ldquo;I had to part with my cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no use; Ogden and myself exploded. Even upon the embarrassed
      Virginian a large grin slowly forced itself. &ldquo;I guess yu' know about it,&rdquo;
       he murmured. And he looked at me with a sort of reproach. He knew it was I
      who had told tales out of school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only want to say,&rdquo; said Ogden, conciliatingly, &ldquo;that I know I couldn't
      have handled those men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian relented. &ldquo;Yu' never tried, seh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge had remained serious; but he showed himself plainly more and
      more contented. &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You had to part with your cook.
      When I put a man in charge, I put him in charge. I don't make particulars
      my business. They're to be always his. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank yu'.&rdquo; The Virginian understood that his employer was praising his
      management of the expedition. But I don't think he at all discerned&mdash;as
      I did presently&mdash;that his employer had just been putting him to a
      further test, had laid before him the temptation of complaining of a
      fellow-workman and blowing his own trumpet, and was delighted with his
      reticence. He made a movement to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't finished,&rdquo; said the Judge. &ldquo;I was coming to the matter. There's
      one particular&mdash;since I do happen to have been told. I fancy Trampas
      has learned something he didn't expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time the Virginian evidently did not understand, any more than I did.
      One hand played with his hat, mechanically turning it round.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge explained. &ldquo;I mean about Roberts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pulse of triumph shot over the Southerner's face, turning it savage for
      that fleeting instant. He understood now, and was unable to suppress this
      much answer. But he was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; the Judge explained to me, &ldquo;I was obliged to let Roberts, my
      old foreman, go last week. His wife could not have stood another winter
      here, and a good position was offered to him near Los Angeles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did see. I saw a number of things. I saw why the foreman's house had
      been empty to receive Dr. MacBride and me. And I saw that the Judge had
      been very clever indeed. For I had abstained from telling any tales about
      the present feeling between Trampas and the Virginian; but he had divined
      it. Well enough for him to say that &ldquo;particulars&rdquo; were something he let
      alone; he evidently kept a deep eye on the undercurrents at his ranch. He
      knew that in Roberts, Trampas had lost a powerful friend. And this was
      what I most saw, this final fact, that Trampas had no longer any
      intervening shield. He and the Virginian stood indeed man to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; the Judge continued speaking to me, &ldquo;here I am at a very
      inconvenient time without a foreman. Unless,&rdquo; I caught the twinkle in his
      eyes before he turned to the Virginian, &ldquo;unless you're willing to take the
      position yourself. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw the Southerner's hand grip his hat as he was turning it round. He
      held it still now, and his other hand found it and gradually crumpled the
      soft crown in. It meant everything to him: recognition, higher station,
      better fortune, a separate house of his own, and&mdash;perhaps&mdash;one
      step nearer to the woman he wanted. I don't know what words he might have
      said to the Judge had they been alone, but the Judge had chosen to do it
      in our presence, the whole thing from beginning to end. The Virginian sat
      with the damp coming out on his forehead, and his eyes dropped from his
      employer's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank yu',&rdquo; was what he managed at last to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, I'm greatly relieved!&rdquo; exclaimed the Judge, rising at once. He
      spoke with haste, and lightly. &ldquo;That's excellent. I was in some thing of a
      hole,&rdquo; he said to Ogden and me; &ldquo;and this gives me one thing less to think
      of. Saves me a lot of particulars,&rdquo; he jocosely added to the Virginian,
      who was now also standing up. &ldquo;Begin right off. Leave the bunk house. The
      gentlemen won't mind your sleeping in your own house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus he dismissed his new foreman gayly. But the new foreman, when he got
      outside, turned back for one gruff word,&mdash;&ldquo;I'll try to please yu'.&rdquo;
       That was all. He was gone in the darkness. But there was light enough for
      me, looking after him, to see him lay his hand on a shoulder-high gate and
      vault it as if he had been the wind. Sounds of cheering came to us a few
      moments later from the bunk house. Evidently he had &ldquo;begun right away,&rdquo; as
      the Judge had directed. He had told his fortune to his brother
      cow-punchers, and this was their answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if Trampas is shouting too?&rdquo; inquired Ogden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; said the Judge. &ldquo;That is one of the particulars I wash my hands of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew that he entirely meant it. I knew, once his decision taken of
      appointing the Virginian his lieutenant for good and all, that, like a
      wise commander-in-chief, he would trust his lieutenant to take care of his
      own business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ogden pursued with interest, &ldquo;haven't you landed Trampas plump at
      his mercy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The phrase tickled the Judge. &ldquo;That is where I've landed him!&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;And here is Dr. MacBride.&rdquo;
     </p>

      XXI. IN A STATE OF SIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thunder sat imminent upon the missionary's brow. Many were to be at his
      mercy soon. But for us he had sunshine still. &ldquo;I am truly sorry to be
      turning you upside down,&rdquo; he said importantly. &ldquo;But it seems the best
      place for my service.&rdquo; He spoke of the tables pushed back and the chairs
      gathered in the hall, where the storm would presently break upon the
      congregation. &ldquo;Eight-thirty?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the hour appointed, and it was only twenty minutes off. We threw
      the unsmoked fractions of our cigars away, and returned to offer our
      services to the ladies. This amused the ladies. They had done without us.
      All was ready in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We got the cook to help us,&rdquo; Mrs. Ogden told me, &ldquo;so as not to disturb
      your cigars. In spite of the cow-boys, I still recognize my own country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the cook?&rdquo; I rather densely asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I don't have a Chinaman. It's in the length of after-dinner
      cigars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you been smoking,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;you would have found them short this
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make it worse,&rdquo; said the lady; &ldquo;we have had nothing but Dr.
      MacBride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll share him with you now,&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he announced his text? I've got one for him,&rdquo; said Molly Wood,
      joining us. She stood on tiptoe and spoke it comically in our ears. &ldquo;'I
      said in my haste, All men are liars.'&rdquo; This made us merry as we stood
      among the chairs in the congested hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left the ladies, and sought the bunk house. I had heard the cheers, but
      I was curious also to see the men, and how they were taking it. There was
      but little for the eye. There was much noise in the room. They were
      getting ready to come to church,&mdash;brushing their hair, shaving, and
      making themselves clean, amid talk occasionally profane and continuously
      diverting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm a Christian, anyway,&rdquo; one declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a Mormon, I guess,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I belong to the Knights of Pythias,&rdquo; said a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a Mohammedist,&rdquo; said a fourth; &ldquo;I hope I ain't goin' to hear nothin'
      to shock me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they went on with their joking. But Trampas was out of the joking. He
      lay on his bed reading a newspaper, and took no pains to look pleasant. My
      eyes were considering him when the blithe Scipio came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't look so bashful,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There's only us girls here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had been helping the Virginian move his belongings from the bunk house
      over to the foreman's cabin. He himself was to occupy the Virginian's old
      bed here. &ldquo;And I hope sleepin' in it will bring me some of his luck,&rdquo; said
      Scipio. &ldquo;Yu'd ought to've seen us when he told us in his quiet way. Well,&rdquo;
       Scipio sighed a little, &ldquo;it must feel good to have your friends glad about
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially Trampas,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The Judge knows about that,&rdquo; I added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knows, does he? What's he say?&rdquo; Scipio drew me quickly out of the bunk
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Says it's no business of his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said nothing but that?&rdquo; Scipio's curiosity seemed strangely intense.
      &ldquo;Made no suggestion? Not a thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing. Said he didn't want to know and didn't care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he happen to hear about it?&rdquo; snapped Scipio. &ldquo;You told him!&rdquo; he
      immediately guessed. &ldquo;He never would.&rdquo; And Scipio jerked his thumb at the
      Virginian, who appeared for a moment in the lighted window of the new
      quarters he was arranging. &ldquo;He never would tell,&rdquo; Scipio repeated. &ldquo;And so
      the Judge never made a suggestion to him,&rdquo; he muttered, nodding in the
      darkness. &ldquo;So it's just his own notion. Just like him, too, come to think
      of it. Only I didn't expect&mdash;well, I guess he could surprise me any
      day he tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're surprising me now,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What's it all about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, him and Trampas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Nothing surely happened yet?&rdquo; I was as curious as Scipio had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet. But there will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heavens, man! when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as soon as Trampas makes the first move,&rdquo; Scipio replied easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      I became dignified. Scipio had evidently been told things by the
      Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I up and asked him plumb out,&rdquo; Scipio answered. &ldquo;I was liftin' his
      trunk in at the door, and I couldn't stand it no longer, and I asked him
      plumb out. 'Yu've sure got Trampas where yu' want him.' That's what I
      said. And he up and answered and told me. So I know.&rdquo; At this point Scipio
      stopped; I was not to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that your system held so much meanness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it ain't meanness!&rdquo; And he laughed ecstatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you call it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd call it discretion,&rdquo; said Scipio. Then he became serious. &ldquo;It's too
      blamed grand to tell yu'. I'll leave yu' to see it happen. Keep around,
      that's all. Keep around. I pretty near wish I didn't know it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What with my feelings at Scipio's discretion, and my human curiosity, I
      was not in that mood which best profits from a sermon. Yet even though my
      expectations had been cruelly left quivering in mid air, I was not sure
      how much I really wanted to &ldquo;keep around.&rdquo; You will therefore understand
      how Dr. MacBride was able to make a prayer and to read Scripture without
      my being conscious of a word that he had uttered. It was when I saw him
      opening the manuscript of his sermon that I suddenly remembered I was
      sitting, so to speak, in church, and began once more to think of the
      preacher and his congregation. Our chairs were in the front line, of
      course; but, being next the wall, I could easily see the cow-boys behind
      me. They were perfectly decorous. If Mrs. Ogden had looked for pistols,
      daredevil attitudes, and so forth, she must have been greatly
      disappointed. Except for their weather-beaten cheeks and eyes, they were
      simply American young men with mustaches and without, and might have been
      sitting, say, in Danbury, Connecticut. Even Trampas merged quietly with
      the general placidity. The Virginian did not, to be sure, look like
      Danbury, and his frame and his features showed out of the mass; but his
      eyes were upon Dr. MacBride with a creamlike propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our missionary did not choose Miss Wood's text. He made his selection from
      another of the Psalms; and when it came, I did not dare to look at
      anybody; I was much nearer unseemly conduct than the cow-boys. Dr.
      MacBride gave us his text sonorously, &ldquo;'They are altogether become filthy;
      There is none of them that doeth good, no, not one.'&rdquo; His eye showed us
      plainly that present company was not excepted from this. He repeated the
      text once more, then, launching upon his discourse, gave none of us a ray
      of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had heard it all often before; but preached to cow-boys it took on a new
      glare of untimeliness, of grotesque obsoleteness&mdash;as if some one
      should say, &ldquo;Let me persuade you to admire woman,&rdquo; and forthwith hold out
      her bleached bones to you. The cow-boys were told that not only they could
      do no good, but that if they did contrive to, it would not help them. Nay,
      more: not only honest deeds availed them nothing, but even if they
      accepted this especial creed which was being explained to them as
      necessary for salvation, still it might not save them. Their sin was
      indeed the cause of their damnation, yet, keeping from sin, they might
      nevertheless be lost. It had all been settled for them not only before
      they were born, but before Adam was shaped. Having told them this, he
      invited them to glorify the Creator of the scheme. Even if damned, they
      must praise the person who had made them expressly for damnation. That is
      what I heard him prove by logic to these cow-boys. Stone upon stone he
      built the black cellar of his theology, leaving out its beautiful park and
      the sunshine of its garden. He did not tell them the splendor of its past,
      the noble fortress for good that it had been, how its tonic had
      strengthened generations of their fathers. No; wrath he spoke of, and
      never once of love. It was the bishop's way, I knew well, to hold cow-boys
      by homely talk of their special hardships and temptations. And when they
      fell he spoke to them of forgiveness and brought them encouragement. But
      Dr. MacBride never thought once of the lives of these waifs. Like himself,
      like all mankind, they were invisible dots in creation; like him, they
      were to feel as nothing, to be swept up in the potent heat of his faith.
      So he thrust out to them none of the sweet but all the bitter of his
      creed, naked and stern as iron. Dogma was his all in all, and poor
      humanity was nothing but flesh for its canons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus to kill what chance he had for being of use seemed to me more
      deplorable than it did evidently to them. Their attention merely wandered.
      Three hundred years ago they would have been frightened; but not in this
      electric day. I saw Scipio stifling a smile when it came to the doctrine
      of original sin. &ldquo;We know of its truth,&rdquo; said Dr. MacBride, &ldquo;from the
      severe troubles and distresses to which infants are liable, and from death
      passing upon them before they are capable of sinning.&rdquo; Yet I knew he was a
      good man; and I also knew that if a missionary is to be tactless, he might
      almost as well be bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said their attention wandered, but I forgot the Virginian. At first his
      attitude might have been mere propriety. One can look respectfully at a
      preacher and be internally breaking all the commandments. But even with
      the text I saw real attention light in the Virginian's eye. And keeping
      track of the concentration that grew on him with each minute made the
      sermon short for me. He missed nothing. Before the end his gaze at the
      preacher had become swerveless. Was he convert or critic? Convert was
      incredible. Thus was an hour passed before I had thought of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was over we took it variously. The preacher was genial and spoke
      of having now broken ground for the lessons that he hoped to instil. He
      discoursed for a while about trout-fishing and about the rumored
      uneasiness of the Indians northward where he was going. It was plain that
      his personal safety never gave him a thought. He soon bade us good night.
      The Ogdens shrugged their shoulders and were amused. That was their way of
      taking it. Dr. MacBride sat too heavily on the Judge's shoulders for him
      to shrug them. As a leading citizen in the Territory he kept open house
      for all comers. Policy and good nature made him bid welcome a wide variety
      of travellers. The cow-boy out of employment found bed and a meal for
      himself and his horse, and missionaries had before now been well received
      at Sunk Creek Ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I'll have to take him fishing,&rdquo; said the Judge, ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;you will. And I shall have to make his tea
      for six days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Otherwise,&rdquo; Ogden suggested, &ldquo;it might be reported that you were enemies
      of religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's about it,&rdquo; said the Judge. &ldquo;I can get on with most people. But
      elephants depress me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we named the Doctor &ldquo;Jumbo,&rdquo; and I departed to my quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the bunk house, the comments were similar but more highly salted. The
      men were going to bed. In spite of their outward decorum at the service,
      they had not liked to be told that they were &ldquo;altogether become filthy.&rdquo;
       It was easy to call names; they could do that themselves. And they
      appealed to me, several speaking at once, like a concerted piece at the
      opera: &ldquo;Say, do you believe babies go to hell?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, of course he
      don't.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;There ain't no hereafter, anyway.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ain't there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Who
      told yu'?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Same man as told the preacher we were all a sifted set
      of sons-of-guns.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I'm going to stay a Mormon.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well,
      I'm going to quit fleeing from temptation.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;that's so! Better get
      it in the neck after a good time than a poor one.&rdquo; And so forth. Their wit
      was not extreme, yet I should like Dr. MacBride to have heard it. One
      fellow put his natural soul pretty well into words, &ldquo;If I happened to
      learn what they had predestinated me to do, I'd do the other thing, just
      to show 'em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Trampas? And the Virginian? They were out of it. The Virginian had
      gone straight to his new abode. Trampas lay in his bed, not asleep, and
      sullen as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain't got religion this trip,&rdquo; said Scipio to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did his new foreman get it?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! It would spoil him. You keep around that's all. Keep around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scipio was not to be probed; and I went, still baffled, to my repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      No light burned in the cabin as I approached its door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian's room was quiet and dark; and that Dr. MacBride slumbered
      was plainly audible to me, even before I entered. Go fishing with him! I
      thought, as I undressed. And I selfishly decided that the Judge might have
      this privilege entirely to himself. Sleep came to me fairly soon, in spite
      of the Doctor. I was wakened from it by my bed's being jolted&mdash;not a
      pleasant thing that night. I must have started. And it was the quiet voice
      of the Virginian that told me he was sorry to have accidentally disturbed
      me. This disturbed me a good deal more. But his steps did not go to the
      bunk house, as my sensational mind had suggested. He was not wearing much,
      and in the dimness he seemed taller than common. I next made out that he
      was bending over Dr. MacBride. The divine at last sprang upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am armed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Take care. Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can lay down your gun, seh. I feel like my spirit was going to bear
      witness. I feel like I might get an enlightening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was using some of the missionary's own language. The baffling I had
      been treated to by Scipio melted to nothing in this. Did living men
      petrify, I should have changed to mineral between the sheets. The Doctor
      got out of bed, lighted his lamp, and found a book; and the two retired
      into the Virginian's room, where I could hear the exhortations as I lay
      amazed. In time the Doctor returned, blew out his lamp, and settled
      himself. I had been very much awake, but was nearly gone to sleep again,
      when the door creaked and the Virginian stood by the Doctor's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you awake, seh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? What's that? What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, seh. The enemy is winning on me. I'm feeling less inward
      opposition to sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lamp was lighted, and I listened to some further exhortations. They
      must have taken half an hour. When the Doctor was in bed again, I thought
      that I heard him sigh. This upset my composure in the dark; but I lay face
      downward in the pillow, and the Doctor was soon again snoring. I envied
      him for a while his faculty of easy sleep. But I must have dropped off
      myself; for it was the lamp in my eyes that now waked me as he came back
      for the third time from the Virginian's room. Before blowing the light out
      he looked at his watch, and thereupon I inquired the hour of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not sleep any more now, and I lay watching the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afeared to be alone!&rdquo; said the Virginian's voice presently in the
      next room. &ldquo;I'm afeared.&rdquo; There was a short pause, and then he shouted
      very loud, &ldquo;I'm losin' my desire afteh the sincere milk of the Word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? What's that? What?&rdquo; The Doctor's cot gave a great crack as he
      started up listening, and I put my face deep in the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afeared! I'm afeared! Sin has quit being bitter in my belly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage, my good man.&rdquo; The Doctor was out of bed with his lamp again, and
      the door shut behind him. Between them they made it long this time. I saw
      the window become gray; then the corners of the furniture grow visible;
      and outside, the dry chorus of the blackbirds began to fill the dawn. To
      these the sounds of chickens and impatient hoofs in the stable were added,
      and some cow wandered by loudly calling for her calf. Next, some one
      whistling passed near and grew distant. But although the cold hue that I
      lay staring at through the window warmed and changed, the Doctor continued
      working hard over his patient in the next room. Only a word here and there
      was distinct; but it was plain from the Virginian's fewer remarks that the
      sin in his belly was alarming him less. Yes, they made this time long. But
      it proved, indeed, the last one. And though some sort of catastrophe was
      bound to fall upon us, it was myself who precipitated the thing that did
      happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day was wholly come. I looked at my own watch, and it was six. I had been
      about seven hours in my bed, and the Doctor had been about seven hours out
      of his. The door opened, and he came in with his book and lamp. He seemed
      to be shivering a little, and I saw him cast a longing eye at his couch.
      But the Virginian followed him even as he blew out the now quite
      superfluous light. They made a noticeable couple in their underclothes:
      the Virginian with his lean racehorse shanks running to a point at his
      ankle, and the Doctor with his stomach and his fat sedentary calves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be going to breakfast and the ladies, seh, pretty soon,&rdquo; said the
      Virginian, with a chastened voice. &ldquo;But I'll worry through the day somehow
      without yu'. And to-night you can turn your wolf loose on me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more it was no use. My face was deep in the pillow, but I made sounds
      as of a hen who has laid an egg. It broke on the Doctor with a total
      instantaneous smash, quite like an egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to speak calmly. &ldquo;This is a disgrace. An infamous disgrace. Never
      in my life have I&mdash;&rdquo; Words forsook him, and his face grew redder.
      &ldquo;Never in my life&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped again, because, at the sight of him
      being dignified in his red drawers, I was making the noise of a dozen
      hens. It was suddenly too much for the Virginian. He hastened into his
      room, and there sank on the floor with his head in his hands. The Doctor
      immediately slammed the door upon him, and this rendered me easily fit for
      a lunatic asylum. I cried into my pillow, and wondered if the Doctor would
      come and kill me. But he took no notice of me whatever. I could hear the
      Virginian's convulsions through the door, and also the Doctor furiously
      making his toilet within three feet of my head; and I lay quite still with
      my face the other way, for I was really afraid to look at him. When I
      heard him walk to the door in his boots, I ventured to peep; and there he
      was, going out with his bag in his hand. As I still continued to lie, weak
      and sore, and with a mind that had ceased all operation, the Virginian's
      door opened. He was clean and dressed and decent, but the devil still
      sported in his eye. I have never seen a creature more irresistibly
      handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then my mind worked again. &ldquo;You've gone and done it,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;He's packed
      his valise. He'll not sleep here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian looked quickly out of the door. &ldquo;Why, he's leavin' us!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. &ldquo;Drivin' away right now in his little old buggy!&rdquo; He turned to
      me, and our eyes met solemnly over this large fact. I thought that I
      perceived the faintest tincture of dismay in the features of Judge Henry's
      new, responsible, trusty foreman. This was the first act of his
      administration. Once again he looked out at the departing missionary.
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he vindictively stated, &ldquo;I cert'nly ain't goin' to run afteh him.&rdquo;
       And he looked at me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose the Judge knows?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;The windo' shades is all down still oveh yondeh.&rdquo; He
      paused. &ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; he stated, quite as if he had been ten years old.
      Then he grinned guiltily. &ldquo;I was mighty respectful to him all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, respectful! Especially when you invited him to turn his wolf
      loose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian gave a joyous gulp. He now came and sat down on the edge of
      my bed. &ldquo;I spoke awful good English to him most of the time,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
      can, yu' know, when I cinch my attention tight on to it. Yes, I cert'nly
      spoke a lot o' good English. I didn't understand some of it myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was now growing frankly pleased with his exploit. He had builded so
      much better than he knew. He got up and looked out across the crystal
      world of light. &ldquo;The Doctor is at one-mile crossing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He'll get
      breakfast at the N-lazy-Y.&rdquo; Then he returned and sat again on my bed, and
      began to give me his real heart. &ldquo;I never set up for being better than
      others. Not even to myself. My thoughts ain't apt to travel around making
      comparisons. And I shouldn't wonder if my memory took as much notice of
      the meannesses I have done as of&mdash;as of the other actions. But to
      have to sit like a dumb lamb and let a stranger tell yu' for an hour that
      yu're a hawg and a swine, just after you have acted in a way which them
      that know the facts would call pretty near white&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trampas!&rdquo; I could not help exclaiming.
    </p>
    <p>
      For there are moments of insight when a guess amounts to knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Scipio told&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not a word. He wouldn't tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yu' see, I arrived home hyeh this evenin' with several thoughts
      workin' and stirrin' inside me. And not one o' them thoughts was what yu'd
      call Christian. I ain't the least little bit ashamed of 'em. I'm a human.
      But after the Judge&mdash;well, yu' heard him. And so when I went away
      from that talk and saw how positions was changed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A step outside stopped him short. Nothing more could be read in his face,
      for there was Trampas himself in the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Trampas, not looking at us. He spoke with the same
      cool sullenness of yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned his greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I'm late in congratulating you on your promotion,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian consulted his watch. &ldquo;It's only half afteh six,&rdquo; he
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trampas's sullenness deepened. &ldquo;Any man is to be congratulated on getting
      a rise, I expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time the Virginian let him have it. &ldquo;Cert'nly. And I ain't forgetting
      how much I owe mine to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trampas would have liked to let himself go. &ldquo;I've not come here for any
      forgiveness,&rdquo; he sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did yu' feel yu' needed any?&rdquo; The Virginian was impregnable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trampas seemed to feel how little he was gaining this way. He came out
      straight now. &ldquo;Oh, I haven't any Judge behind me, I know. I heard you'd be
      paying the boys this morning, and I've come for my time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're thinking of leaving us?&rdquo; asked the new foreman. &ldquo;What's your
      dissatisfaction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm not needing anybody back of me. I'll get along by myself.&rdquo; It was
      thus he revealed his expectation of being dismissed by his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This would have knocked any meditated generosity out of my heart. But I
      was not the Virginian. He shifted his legs, leaned back a little, and
      laughed. &ldquo;Go back to your job, Trampas, if that's all your complaint.
      You're right about me being in luck. But maybe there's two of us in luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was this that Scipio had preferred me to see with my own eyes. The
      fight was between man and man no longer. The case could not be one of
      forgiveness; but the Virginian would not use his official position to
      crush his subordinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trampas departed with something muttered that I did not hear, and the
      Virginian closed intimate conversation by saying, &ldquo;You'll be late for
      breakfast.&rdquo; With that he also took himself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies were inclined to be scandalized, but not the Judge. When my
      whole story was done, he brought his fist down on the table, and not
      lightly this time. &ldquo;I'd make him lieutenant general if the ranch offered
      that position!&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Molly Wood said nothing at the time. But in the afternoon, by her
      wish, she went fishing, with the Virginian deputed to escort her. I rode
      with them, for a while. I was not going to continue a third in that party;
      the Virginian was too becomingly dressed, and I saw KENILWORTH peeping out
      of his pocket. I meant to be fishing by myself when that volume was
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Wood talked with skilful openness as we rode. &ldquo;I've heard all
      about you and Dr. MacBride,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How could you do it, when the
      Judge places such confidence in you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked pleased. &ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I couldn't be so good if I wasn't
      bad onced in a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there's a skunk,&rdquo; said I, noticing the pretty little animal trotting
      in front of us at the edge of the thickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, where is it? Don't let me see it!&rdquo; screamed Molly. And at this deeply
      feminine remark, the Virginian looked at her with such a smile that, had I
      been a woman, it would have made me his to do what he pleased with on the
      spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the lady, however, it seemed to make less impression. Or rather, I
      had better say, whatever were her feelings, she very naturally made no
      display of them, and contrived not to be aware of that expression which
      had passed over the Virginian's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was later that these few words reached me while I was fishing alone:
      &ldquo;Have you anything different to tell me yet?&rdquo; I heard him say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I have.&rdquo; She spoke in accents light and well intrenched. &ldquo;I wish to
      say that I have never liked any man better than you. But I expect to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He must have drawn small comfort from such an answer as that. But he
      laughed out indomitably: &ldquo;Don't yu' go betting on any such expectation!&rdquo;
       And then their words ceased to be distinct, and it was only their two
      voices that I heard wandering among the windings of the stream.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XXII. &ldquo;WHAT IS A RUSTLER?&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      We all know what birds of a feather do. And it may be safely surmised that
      if a bird of any particular feather has been for a long while unable to
      see other birds of its kind, it will flock with them all the more
      assiduously when they happen to alight in its vicinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Ogdens were birds of Molly's feather. They wore Eastern, and not
      Western, plumage, and their song was a different song from that which the
      Bear Creek birds sang. To be sure, the piping of little George Taylor was
      full of hopeful interest; and many other strains, both striking and
      melodious, were lifted in Cattle Land, and had given pleasure to Molly's
      ear. But although Indians, and bears, and mavericks, make worthy themes
      for song, these are not the only songs in the world. Therefore the Eastern
      warblings of the Ogdens sounded doubly sweet to Molly Wood. Such words as
      Newport, Bar Harbor, and Tiffany's thrilled her exceedingly. It made no
      difference that she herself had never been to Newport or Bar Harbor, and
      had visited Tiffany's more often to admire than to purchase. On the
      contrary, this rather added a dazzle to the music of the Ogdens. And
      Molly, whose Eastern song had been silent in this strange land, began to
      chirp it again during the visit that she made at the Sunk Creek Ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Virginian's cause by no means prospered at this time. His forces
      were scattered, while Molly's were concentrated. The girl was not at that
      point where absence makes the heart grow fonder. While the Virginian was
      trundling his long, responsible miles in the caboose, delivering the
      cattle at Chicago, vanquishing Trampas along the Yellowstone, she had
      regained herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that she could tell him so easily during those first hours
      that they were alone after his return, &ldquo;I expect to like another man
      better than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Absence had recruited her. And then the Ogdens had reenforced her. They
      brought the East back powerfully to her memory, and her thoughts filled
      with it. They did not dream that they were assisting in any battle. No one
      ever had more unconscious allies than did Molly at that time. But she used
      them consciously, or almost consciously. She frequented them; she spoke of
      Eastern matters; she found that she had acquaintances whom the Ogdens also
      knew, and she often brought them into the conversation. For it may be
      said, I think, that she was fighting a battle&mdash;nay, a campaign. And
      perhaps this was a hopeful sign for the Virginian (had he but known it),
      that the girl resorted to allies. She surrounded herself, she steeped
      herself, with the East, to have, as it were, a sort of counteractant
      against the spell of the black-haired horse man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And his forces were, as I have said, scattered. For his promotion gave him
      no more time for love-making. He was foreman now. He had said to Judge
      Henry, &ldquo;I'll try to please yu'.&rdquo; And after the throb of emotion which
      these words had both concealed and conveyed, there came to him that sort
      of intention to win which amounts to a certainty. Yes, he would please
      Judge Henry!
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know how much he had already pleased him. He did not know that
      the Judge was humorously undecided which of his new foreman's first acts
      had the more delighted him: his performance with the missionary, or his
      magnanimity to Trampas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good feeling is a great thing in any one,&rdquo; the Judge would say; &ldquo;but I
      like to know that my foreman has so much sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am personally very grateful to him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed so was the whole company. To be afflicted with Dr. MacBride for
      one night instead of six was a great liberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Virginian never saw his sweetheart alone again; while she was at
      the Sunk Creek Ranch, his duties called him away so much that there was no
      chance for him. Worse still, that habit of birds of a feather brought
      about a separation more considerable. She arranged to go East with the
      Ogdens. It was so good an opportunity to travel with friends, instead of
      making the journey alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly's term of ministration at the schoolhouse had so pleased Bear Creek
      that she was warmly urged to take a holiday. School could afford to begin
      a little late. Accordingly, she departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian hid his sore heart from her during the moment of farewell
      that they had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'll not want any more books,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;till yu' come back.&rdquo; And
      then he made cheerfulness. &ldquo;It's just the other way round!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the other way round?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, last time it was me that went travelling, and you that stayed
      behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was!&rdquo; And here she gave him a last scratch. &ldquo;But you'll be busier
      than ever,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;no spare time to grieve about me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could wound him, and she knew it. Nobody else could. That is why she
      did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he gave her something to remember, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;neither of us will stay behind. We'll both go
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with these words he gave her no laughing glance. It was a look that
      mingled with the words; so that now and again in the train, both came back
      to her, and she sat pensive, drawing near to Bennington and hearing his
      voice and seeing his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      How is it that this girl could cry at having to tell Sam Bannett she could
      not think of him, and then treat another lover as she treated the
      Virginian? I cannot tell you, having never (as I said before) been a woman
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bennington opened its arms to its venturesome daughter. Much was made of
      Molly Wood. Old faces and old places welcomed her. Fatted calves of
      varying dimensions made their appearance. And although the fatted calf is
      an animal that can assume more divergent shapes than any other known
      creature,&mdash;being sometimes champagne and partridges, and again cake
      and currant wine,&mdash;through each disguise you can always identify the
      same calf. The girl from Bear Creek met it at every turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bannetts at Hoosic Falls offered a large specimen to Molly&mdash;a
      dinner (perhaps I should say a banquet) of twenty-four. And Sam Bannett of
      course took her to drive more than once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see the Hoosic Bridge,&rdquo; she would say. And when they reached
      that well-remembered point, &ldquo;How lovely it is!&rdquo; she exclaimed. And as she
      gazed at the view up and down the valley, she would grow pensive. &ldquo;How
      natural the church looks,&rdquo; she continued. And then, having crossed both
      bridges, &ldquo;Oh, there's the dear old lodge gate!&rdquo; Or again, while they drove
      up the valley of the little Hoosic: &ldquo;I had forgotten it was so nice and
      lonely. But after all, no woods are so interesting as those where you
      might possibly see a bear or an elk.&rdquo; And upon another occasion, after a
      cry of enthusiasm at the view from the top of Mount Anthony, &ldquo;It's lovely,
      lovely, lovely,&rdquo; she said, with diminishing cadence, ending in pensiveness
      once more. &ldquo;Do you see that little bit just there? No, not where the trees
      are&mdash;that bare spot that looks brown and warm in the sun. With a
      little sagebrush, that spot would look something like a place I know on
      Bear Creek. Only of course you don't get the clear air here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't forget you,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Do you remember me? Or is it out of sight
      out of mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with this beginning he renewed his suit. She told him that she forgot
      no one; that she should return always, lest they might forget her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return always!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You talk as if your anchor was dragging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was it? At all events, Sam failed in his suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over in the house at Dunbarton, the old lady held Molly's hand and looked
      a long while at her. &ldquo;You have changed very much,&rdquo; she said finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a year older,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw, my dear!&rdquo; said the great-aunt. &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody!&rdquo; cried Molly, with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you shouldn't answer so loud,&rdquo; said the great-aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl suddenly hid her face. &ldquo;I don't believe I can love any one,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;except myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then that old lady, who in her day had made her courtesy to Lafayette,
      began to stroke her niece's buried head, because she more than half
      understood. And understanding thus much, she asked no prying questions,
      but thought of the days of her own youth, and only spoke a little quiet
      love and confidence to Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an old, old woman,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I haven't forgotten about it.
      They objected to him because he had no fortune. But he was brave and
      handsome, and I loved him, my dear. Only I ought to have loved him more. I
      gave him my promise to think about it. And he and his ship were lost.&rdquo; The
      great-aunt's voice had become very soft and low, and she spoke with many
      pauses. &ldquo;So then I knew. If I had&mdash;if&mdash;perhaps I should have
      lost him; but it would have been after&mdash;ah, well! So long as you can
      help it, never marry! But when you cannot help it a moment longer, then
      listen to nothing but that; for, my dear, I know your choice would be
      worthy of the Starks. And now&mdash;let me see his picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, aunty!&rdquo; said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I won't pretend to be supernatural,&rdquo; said the aunt, &ldquo;but I thought
      you kept one back when you were showing us those Western views last
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now this was the precise truth. Molly had brought a number of photographs
      from Wyoming to show to her friends at home. These, however, with one
      exception, were not portraits. They were views of scenery and of cattle
      round-ups, and other scenes characteristic of ranch life. Of young men she
      had in her possession several photographs, and all but one of these she
      had left behind her. Her aunt's penetration had in a way mesmerized the
      girl; she rose obediently and sought that picture of the Virginian. It was
      full length, displaying him in all his cow-boy trappings,&mdash;the
      leathern chaps, the belt and pistol, and in his hand a coil of rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one of her family had seen it, or suspected its existence. She now
      brought it downstairs and placed it in her aunt's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; cried the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly was silent, but her eye grew warlike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the way&mdash;&rdquo; began the aunt. &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; she murmured; and she
      sat staring at the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her aunt looked slowly up at her. &ldquo;Has a man like that presumed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's not a bit like that. Yes, he's exactly like that,&rdquo; said Molly. And
      she would have snatched the photograph away, but her aunt retained it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I suppose there are days when he does not kill people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never killed anybody!&rdquo; And Molly laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you seriously&mdash;&rdquo; said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I almost might&mdash;at times. He is perfectly splendid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you have fallen in love with his clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not his clothes. And I'm not in love. He often wears others. He
      wears a white collar like anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that would be a more suitable way to be photographed, I think. He
      couldn't go round like that here. I could not receive him myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd never think of such a thing. Why, you talk as if he were a savage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady studied the picture closely for a minute. &ldquo;I think it is a
      good face,&rdquo; she finally remarked. &ldquo;Is the fellow as handsome as that, my
      dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More so, Molly thought. And who was he, and what were his prospects? were
      the aunt's next inquiries. She shook her head at the answers which she
      received; and she also shook her head over her niece's emphatic denial
      that her heart was lost to this man. But when their parting came, the old
      lady said: &ldquo;God bless you and keep you, my dear. I'll not try to manage
      you. They managed me&mdash;&rdquo; A sigh spoke the rest of this sentence. &ldquo;But
      I'm not worried about you&mdash;at least, not very much. You have never
      done anything that was not worthy of the Starks. And if you're going to
      take him, do it before I die so that I can bid him welcome for your sake.
      God bless you, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And after the girl had gone back to Bennington, the great-aunt had this
      thought: &ldquo;She is like us all. She wants a man that is a man.&rdquo; Nor did the
      old lady breathe her knowledge to any member of the family. For she was a
      loyal spirit, and her girl's confidence was sacred to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;if even I can do nothing with her, what a mess
      THEY'D make of it! We should hear of her elopement next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Molly's immediate family never saw that photograph, and never heard a
      word from her upon this subject. But on the day that she left for Bear
      Creek, as they sat missing her and discussing her visit in the evening,
      Mrs. Bell observed: &ldquo;Mother, how did you think she was?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I never
      saw her better, Sarah. That horrible place seems to agree with her.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
      yes, agree. It seemed to me&mdash;&ldquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, just somehow
      that she was thinking.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thinking?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I believe she has
      something on her mind.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You mean a man,&rdquo; said Andrew Bell.&mdash;&ldquo;A
      man, Andrew?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Wood, that's what Sarah always means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may be mentioned that Sarah's surmises did not greatly contribute to
      her mother's happiness. And rumor is so strange a thing that presently
      from the malicious outside air came a vague and dreadful word&mdash;one of
      those words that cannot be traced to its source. Somebody said to Andrew
      Bell that they heard Miss Molly Wood was engaged to marry a RUSTLER.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens, Andrew!&rdquo; said his wife; &ldquo;what is a rustler?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not in any dictionary, and current translations of it were
      inconsistent. A man at Hoosic Falls said that he had passed through
      Cheyenne, and heard the term applied in a complimentary way to people who
      were alive and pushing. Another man had always supposed it meant some kind
      of horse. But the most alarming version of all was that a rustler was a
      cattle thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the truth is that all these meanings were right. The word ran a sort
      of progress in the cattle country, gathering many meanings as it went. It
      gathered more, however, in Bennington. In a very few days, gossip had it
      that Molly was engaged to a gambler, a gold miner, an escaped stage
      robber, and a Mexican bandit; while Mrs. Flynt feared she had married a
      Mormon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along Bear Creek, however, Molly and her &ldquo;rustler&rdquo; took a ride soon after
      her return. They were neither married nor engaged, and she was telling him
      about Vermont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was there,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Never happened to strike in that
      direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What decided your direction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, looking for chances. I reckon I must have been more ambitious than my
      brothers&mdash;or more restless. They stayed around on farms. But I got
      out. When I went back again six years afterward, I was twenty. They was
      talking about the same old things. Men of twenty-five and thirty&mdash;yet
      just sittin' and talkin' about the same old things. I told my mother about
      what I'd seen here and there, and she liked it, right to her death. But
      the others&mdash;well, when I found this whole world was hawgs and turkeys
      to them, with a little gunnin' afteh small game throwed in, I put on my
      hat one mawnin' and told 'em maybe when I was fifty I'd look in on 'em
      again to see if they'd got any new subjects. But they'll never. My
      brothers don't seem to want chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have lost a good many yourself,&rdquo; said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;sometimes I think you know a great deal more than I
      ever shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course I do,&rdquo; said he, quite simply. &ldquo;I have earned my living
      since I was fourteen. And that's from old Mexico to British Columbia. I
      have never stolen or begged a cent. I'd not want yu' to know what I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was looking at him, half listening and half thinking of her
      great-aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not losing chances any more,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;And you are the best
      I've got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was not sorry to have Georgie Taylor come galloping along at this
      moment and join them. But the Virginian swore profanely under his breath.
      And on this ride nothing more happened.

      XXIII. VARIOUS POINTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Love had been snowbound for many weeks. Before this imprisonment its
      course had run neither smooth nor rough, so far as eye could see; it had
      run either not at all, or, as an undercurrent, deep out of sight. In their
      rides, in their talks, love had been dumb, as to spoken words at least;
      for the Virginian had set himself a heavy task of silence and of patience.
      Then, where winter barred his visits to Bear Creek, and there was for the
      while no ranch work or responsibility to fill his thoughts and blood with
      action, he set himself a task much lighter. Often, instead of Shakespeare
      and fiction, school books lay open on his cabin table; and penmanship and
      spelling helped the hours to pass. Many sheets of paper did he fill with
      various exercises, and Mrs. Henry gave him her assistance in advice and
      corrections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall presently be in love with him myself,&rdquo; she told the Judge. &ldquo;And
      it's time for you to become anxious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly safe,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;There's only one woman for him any
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not good enough for him,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Henry. &ldquo;But he'll never
      see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the snow fell, the world froze, and the spelling-books and exercises
      went on. But this was not the only case of education which was progressing
      at the Sunk Creek Ranch while love was snowbound.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning Scipio le Moyne entered the Virginian's sitting room&mdash;that
      apartment where Dr. MacBride had wrestled with sin so courageously all
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian sat at his desk. Open books lay around him; a half-finished
      piece of writing was beneath his fist; his fingers were coated with ink.
      Education enveloped him, it may be said. But there was none in his eye.
      That was upon the window, looking far across the cold plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreman did not move when Scipio came in, and this humorous spirit
      smiled to himself. &ldquo;It's Bear Creek he's havin' a vision of,&rdquo; he
      concluded. But he knew instantly that this was not so. The Virginian was
      looking at something real, and Scipio went to the window to see for
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, having seen, &ldquo;when is he going to leave us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The foreman continued looking at two horsemen riding together. Their
      shapes, small in the distance, showed black against the universal
      whiteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When d' yu' figure he'll leave us?&rdquo; repeated Scipio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He,&rdquo; murmured the Virginian, always watching the distant horsemen; and
      again, &ldquo;he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scipio sprawled down, familiarly, across a chair. He and the Virginian had
      come to know each other very well since that first meeting at Medora. They
      were birds many of whose feathers were the same, and the Virginian often
      talked to Scipio without reserve. Consequently, Scipio now understood
      those two syllables that the Virginian had pronounced precisely as though
      the sentences which lay between them had been fully expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Well, one will be a gain, and the other won't be no
      loss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Shorty!&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;Poor fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scipio was less compassionate. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he persisted, &ldquo;I ain't sorry for him.
      Any man old enough to have hair on his face ought to see through Trampas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian looked out of the window again, and watched Shorty and
      Trampas as they rode in the distance. &ldquo;Shorty is kind to animals,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;He has gentled that hawss Pedro he bought with his first money.
      Gentled him wonderful. When a man is kind to dumb animals, I always say he
      had got some good in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Scipio reluctantly admitted. &ldquo;Yes. But I always did hate a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This hyeh is a mighty cruel country,&rdquo; pursued the Virginian. &ldquo;To animals
      that is. Think of it! Think what we do to hundreds an' thousands of little
      calves! Throw 'em down, brand 'em, cut 'em, ear mark 'em, turn 'em loose,
      and on to the next. It has got to be, of course. But I say this. If a man
      can go jammin' hot irons on to little calves and slicin' pieces off 'em
      with his knife, and live along, keepin' a kindness for animals in his
      heart, he has got some good in him. And that's what Shorty has got. But he
      is lettin' Trampas get a hold of him, and both of them will leave us.&rdquo; And
      the Virginian looked out across the huge winter whiteness again. But the
      riders had now vanished behind some foot-hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scipio sat silent. He had never put these thoughts about men and animals
      to himself, and when they were put to him, he saw that they were true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer,&rdquo; he observed finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing's queer,&rdquo; stated the Virginian, &ldquo;except marriage and lightning.
      Them two occurrences can still give me a sensation of surprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same it is queer,&rdquo; Scipio insisted
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let her go at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Trampas. He done you dirt. You pass that over. You could have fired
      him, but you let him stay and keep his job. That's goodness. And badness
      is resultin' from it, straight. Badness right from goodness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're off the trail a whole lot,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which side am I off, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;North, south, east, and west. First point. I didn't expect to do Trampas
      any good by not killin' him, which I came pretty near doin' three times.
      Nor I didn't expect to do Trampas any good by lettin' him keep his job.
      But I am foreman of this ranch. And I can sit and tell all men to their
      face: 'I was above that meanness.' Point two: it ain't any GOODNESS, it is
      TRAMPAS that badness has resulted from. Put him anywhere and it will be
      the same. Put him under my eye, and I can follow his moves a little,
      anyway. You have noticed, maybe, that since you and I run on to that dead
      Polled Angus cow, that was still warm when we got to her, we have found no
      more cows dead of sudden death. We came mighty close to catchin' whoever
      it was that killed that cow and ran her calf off to his own bunch. He
      wasn't ten minutes ahead of us. We can prove nothin'; and he knows that
      just as well as we do. But our cows have all quit dyin' of sudden death.
      And Trampas he's gettin' ready for a change of residence. As soon as all
      the outfits begin hirin' new hands in the spring, Trampas will leave us
      and take a job with some of them. And maybe our cows'll commence gettin'
      killed again, and we'll have to take steps that will be more emphatic&mdash;maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scipio meditated. &ldquo;I wonder what killin' a man feels like?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, nothing to bother yu'&mdash;when he'd ought to have been killed.
      Next point: Trampas he'll take Shorty with him, which is certainly bad for
      Shorty. But it's me that has kept Shorty out of harm's way this long. If I
      had fired Trampas, he'd have worked Shorty into dissatisfaction that much
      sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scipio meditated again. &ldquo;I knowed Trampas would pull his freight,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;But I didn't think of Shorty. What makes you think it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me for a raise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain't worth the pay he's getting now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trampas has told him different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a man ain't got no ideas of his own,&rdquo; said Scipio, &ldquo;he'd ought to be
      kind o' careful who he borrows 'em from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's mighty correct,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;Poor Shorty! He has told me
      about his life. It is sorrowful. And he will never get wise. It was too
      late for him to get wise when he was born. D' yu' know why he's after
      higher wages? He sends most all his money East.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see what Trampas wants him for,&rdquo; said Scipio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a handy tool some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very handy,&rdquo; said Scipio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Trampas is aimin' to train him. Yu' see, supposin' yu' were
      figuring to turn professional thief&mdash;yu'd be lookin' around for a
      nice young trustful accomplice to take all the punishment and let you take
      the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such thing!&rdquo; cried Scipio, angrily. &ldquo;I'm no shirker.&rdquo; And then,
      perceiving the Virginian's expression, he broke out laughing. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, &ldquo;yu' fooled me that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks that way. But I do mean it about Trampas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently Scipio rose, and noticed the half-finished exercise upon the
      Virginian's desk. &ldquo;Trampas is a rolling stone,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rolling piece of mud,&rdquo; corrected the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mud! That's right. I'm a rolling stone. Sometimes I'd most like to quit
      being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's easy done,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, when yu've found the moss yu' want to gather.&rdquo; As Scipio
      glanced at the school books again, a sparkle lurked in his bleached blue
      eye. &ldquo;I can cipher some,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I expect I've got my own notions
      about spelling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I retain a few private ideas that way myself,&rdquo; remarked the Virginian,
      innocently; and Scipio's sparkle gathered light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to my geography,&rdquo; he pursued, &ldquo;that's away out loose in the brush. Is
      Bennington the capital of Vermont? And how d' yu' spell bridegroom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last point!&rdquo; shouted the Virginian, letting a book fly after him: &ldquo;don't
      let badness and goodness worry yu', for yu'll never be a judge of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Scipio had dodged the book, and was gone. As he went his way, he said
      to himself, &ldquo;All the same, it must pay to fall regular in love.&rdquo; At the
      bunk house that afternoon it was observed that he was unusually silent.
      His exit from the foreman's cabin had let in a breath of winter so chill
      that the Virginian went to see his thermometer, a Christmas present from
      Mrs. Henry. It registered twenty below zero. After reviving the fire to a
      white blaze, the foreman sat thinking over the story of Shorty: what its
      useless, feeble past had been; what would be its useless, feeble future.
      He shook his head over the sombre question, Was there any way out for
      Shorty? &ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;that them whose pleasure brings yu'
      into this world owes yu' a living. But that don't make the world
      responsible. The world did not beget you. I reckon man helps them that
      help themselves. As for the universe, it looks like it did too wholesale a
      business to turn out an article up to standard every clip. Yes, it is
      sorrowful. For Shorty is kind to his hawss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the evening the Virginian brought Shorty into his room. He usually knew
      what he had to say, usually found it easy to arrange his thoughts; and
      after such arranging the words came of themselves. But as he looked at
      Shorty, this did not happen to him. There was not a line of badness in the
      face; yet also there was not a line of strength; no promise in eye, or
      nose, or chin; the whole thing melted to a stubby, featureless mediocrity.
      It was a countenance like thousands; and hopelessness filled the Virginian
      as he looked at this lost dog, and his dull, wistful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But some beginning must be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what the thermometer has got to be,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yu' can see it,
      if yu'll hold the lamp to that right side of the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shorty held the lamp. &ldquo;I never used any,&rdquo; he said, looking out at the
      instrument, nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian had forgotten that Shorty could not read. So he looked out
      of the window himself, and found that it was twenty-two below zero. &ldquo;This
      is pretty good tobacco,&rdquo; he remarked; and Shorty helped himself, and
      filled his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to rub my left ear with snow to-day,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was just in
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it looked pretty freezy out where yu' was riding,&rdquo; said the
      foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lost dog's eyes showed plain astonishment. &ldquo;We didn't see you out
      there,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the foreman, &ldquo;it'll soon not be freezing any more; and then
      we'll all be warm enough with work. Everybody will be working all over the
      range. And I wish I knew somebody that had a lot of stable work to be
      attended to. I cert'nly do for your sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Shorty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it's the right kind of a job for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can make more&mdash;&rdquo; began Shorty, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a time coming,&rdquo; said the Virginian, &ldquo;when I'll want somebody
      that knows how to get the friendship of hawsses. I'll want him to handle
      some special hawsses the Judge has plans about. Judge Henry would pay
      fifty a month for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can make more,&rdquo; said Shorty, this time with stubbornness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes. Sometimes a man can&mdash;when he's not worth it, I mean. But
      it don't generally last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shorty was silent. &ldquo;I used to make more myself,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're making a lot more now,&rdquo; said Shorty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. But I mean when I was fooling around the earth, jumping from job
      to job, and helling all over town between whiles. I was not worth fifty a
      month then, nor twenty-five. But there was nights I made a heap more at
      cyards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shorty's eyes grew large.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, bang! it was gone with treatin' the men and the girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't always&mdash;&rdquo; said Shorty, and stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian knew that he was thinking about the money he sent East.
      &ldquo;After a while,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I noticed a right strange fact. The money
      I made easy that I WASN'T worth, it went like it came. I strained myself
      none gettin' or spendin' it. But the money I made hard that I WAS worth,
      why I began to feel right careful about that. And now I have got savings
      stowed away. If once yu' could know how good that feels&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I would know,&rdquo; said Shorty, &ldquo;with your luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's my luck?&rdquo; said the Virginian, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I had took up land along a creek that never goes dry and proved
      upon it like you have, and if I had saw that land raise its value on me
      with me lifting no finger&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you lift no finger?&rdquo; cut in the Virginian. &ldquo;Who stopped yu'
      taking up land? Did it not stretch in front of yu', behind yu', all around
      yu', the biggest, baldest opportunity in sight? That was the time I lifted
      my finger; but yu' didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shorty stood stubborn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But never mind that,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;Take my land away to-morrow,
      and I'd still have my savings in bank. Because, you see, I had to work
      right hard gathering them in. I found out what I could do, and I settled
      down and did it. Now you can do that too. The only tough part is the
      finding out what you're good for. And for you, that is found. If you'll
      just decide to work at this thing you can do, and gentle those hawsses for
      the Judge, you'll be having savings in a bank yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can make more,&rdquo; said the lost dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian was on the point of saying, &ldquo;Then get out!&rdquo; But instead, he
      spoke kindness to the end. &ldquo;The weather is freezing yet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it
      will be for a good long while. Take your time, and tell me if yu' change
      your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that Shorty returned to the bunk house, and the Virginian knew that
      the boy had learned his lesson of discontent from Trampas with a
      thoroughness past all unteaching. This petty triumph of evil seemed scarce
      of the size to count as any victory over the Virginian. But all men grasp
      at straws. Since that first moment, when in the Medicine Bow saloon the
      Virginian had shut the mouth of Trampas by a word, the man had been trying
      to get even without risk; and at each successive clash of his weapon with
      the Virginian's, he had merely met another public humiliation. Therefore,
      now at the Sunk Creek Ranch in these cold white days, a certain lurking
      insolence in his gait showed plainly his opinion that by disaffecting
      Shorty he had made some sort of reprisal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he had poisoned the lost dog. In the springtime, when the neighboring
      ranches needed additional hands, it happened as the Virginian had
      foreseen,&mdash;Trampas departed to a &ldquo;better job,&rdquo; as he took pains to
      say, and with him the docile Shorty rode away upon his horse Pedro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love now was not any longer snowbound. The mountain trails were open
      enough for the sure feet of love's steed&mdash;that horse called Monte.
      But duty blocked the path of love. Instead of turning his face to Bear
      Creek, the foreman had other journeys to make, full of heavy work, and
      watchfulness, and councils with the Judge. The cattle thieves were growing
      bold, and winter had scattered the cattle widely over the range. Therefore
      the Virginian, instead of going to see her, wrote a letter to his
      sweetheart. It was his first.

    <h2>
      XXIV. A LETTER WITH A MORAL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The letter which the Virginian wrote to Molly Wood was, as has been
      stated, the first that he had ever addressed to her. I think, perhaps, he
      may have been a little shy as to his skill in the epistolary art, a little
      anxious lest any sustained production from his pen might contain blunders
      that would too staringly remind her of his scant learning. He could turn
      off a business communication about steers or stock cars, or any other of
      the subjects involved in his profession, with a brevity and a clearness
      that led the Judge to confide three-quarters of such correspondence to his
      foreman. &ldquo;Write to the 76 outfit,&rdquo; the Judge would say, &ldquo;and tell them
      that my wagon cannot start for the round-up until,&rdquo; etc.; or &ldquo;Write to
      Cheyenne and say that if they will hold a meeting next Monday week, I
      will,&rdquo; etc. And then the Virginian would write such communications with
      ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his first message to his lady was scarcely written with ease. It must
      be classed, I think, among those productions which are styled literary
      EFFORTS. It was completed in pencil before it was copied in ink; and that
      first draft of it in pencil was well-nigh illegible with erasures and
      amendments. The state of mind of the writer during its composition may be
      gathered without further description on my part from a slight interruption
      which occurred in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and Scipio put his head in. &ldquo;You coming to dinner?&rdquo; he
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go to hell,&rdquo; replied the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My jinks!&rdquo; said Scipio, quietly, and he shut the door without further
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To tell the truth, I doubt if this letter would ever have been undertaken,
      far less completed and despatched, had not the lover's heart been wrung
      with disappointment. All winter long he had looked to that day when he
      should knock at the girl's door, and hear her voice bid him come in. All
      winter long he had been choosing the ride he would take her. He had
      imagined a sunny afternoon, a hidden grove, a sheltering cleft of rock, a
      running spring, and some words of his that should conquer her at last and
      leave his lips upon hers. And with this controlled fire pent up within
      him, he had counted the days, scratching them off his calendar with a dig
      each night that once or twice snapped the pen. Then, when the trail stood
      open, this meeting was deferred, put off for indefinite days, or weeks; he
      could not tell how long. So, gripping his pencil and tracing heavy words,
      he gave himself what consolation he could by writing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter, duly stamped and addressed to Bear Creek, set forth upon its
      travels; and these were devious and long. When it reached its destination,
      it was some twenty days old. It had gone by private hand at the outset,
      taken the stagecoach at a way point, become late in that stagecoach,
      reached a point of transfer, and waited there for the postmaster to begin,
      continue, end, and recover from a game of poker, mingled with whiskey.
      Then it once more proceeded, was dropped at the right way point, and
      carried by private hand to Bear Creek. The experience of this letter,
      however, was not at all a remarkable one at that time in Wyoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly Wood looked at the envelope. She had never before seen the
      Virginian's handwriting. She knew it instantly. She closed her door and
      sat down to read it with a beating heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUNK CREEK RANCH, May 5, 188-
    </p>
    <p>
      My Dear Miss Wood: I am sorry about this. My plan was different. It was to
      get over for a ride with you about now or sooner. This year Spring is
      early. The snow is off the flats this side the range and where the sun
      gets a chance to hit the earth strong all day it is green and has flowers
      too, a good many. You can see them bob and mix together in the wind. The
      quaking-asps down low on the South side are in small leaf and will soon be
      twinkling like the flowers do now. I had planned to take a look at this
      with you and that was a better plan than what I have got to do. The water
      is high but I could have got over and as for the snow on top of the
      mountain a man told me nobody could cross it for a week yet, because he
      had just done it himself. Was not he a funny man? You ought to see how the
      birds have streamed across the sky while Spring was coming. But you have
      seen them on your side of the mountain. But I can't come now Miss Wood.
      There is a lot for me to do that has to be done and Judge Henry needs more
      than two eyes just now. I could not think much of myself if I left him for
      my own wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the days will be warmer when I come. We will not have to quit by five,
      and we can get off and sit too. We could not sit now unless for a very
      short while. If I know when I can come I will try to let you know, but I
      think it will be this way. I think you will just see me coming for I have
      things to do of an unsure nature and a good number of such. Do not believe
      reports about Indians. They are started by editors to keep the soldiers in
      the country. The friends of the editors get the hay and beef contracts.
      Indians do not come to settled parts like Bear Creek is. It is all editors
      and politicianists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing has happened worth telling you. I have read that play Othello. No
      man should write down such a thing. Do you know if it is true? I have seen
      one worse affair down in Arizona. He killed his little child as well as
      his wife but such things should not be put down in fine language for the
      public. I have read Romeo and Juliet. That is beautiful language but Romeo
      is no man. I like his friend Mercutio that gets killed. He is a man. If he
      had got Juliet there would have been no foolishness and trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well Miss Wood I would like to see you to-day. Do you know what I think
      Monte would do if I rode him out and let the rein slack? He would come
      straight to your gate for he is a horse of great judgement. (&ldquo;That's the
      first word he has misspelled,&rdquo; said Molly.) I suppose you are sitting with
      George Taylor and those children right now. Then George will get old
      enough to help his father but Uncle Hewie's twins will be ready for you
      about then and the supply will keep coming from all quarters all sizes for
      you to say big A little a to them. There is no news here. Only calves and
      cows and the hens are laying now which does always seem news to a hen
      every time she does it. Did I ever tell you about a hen Emily we had here?
      She was venturesome to an extent I have not seen in other hens only she
      had poor judgement and would make no family ties. She would keep trying to
      get interest in the ties of others taking charge of little chicks and
      bantams and turkeys and puppies one time, and she thought most anything
      was an egg. I will tell you about her sometime. She died without family
      ties one day while I was building a house for her to teach school in.
      (&ldquo;The outrageous wretch!&rdquo; cried Molly! And her cheeks turned deep pink as
      she sat alone with her lover's letter.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I am coming the first day I am free. I will be a hundred miles from you
      most of the time when I am not more but I will ride a hundred miles for
      one hour and Monte is up to that. After never seeing you for so long I
      will make one hour do if I have to. Here is a flower I have just been out
      and picked. I have kissed it now. That is the best I can do yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly laid the letter in her lap and looked at the flower. Then suddenly
      she jumped up and pressed it to her lips, and after a long moment held it
      away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No, no, no.&rdquo; She sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before she finished the letter. Then once more she got up
      and put on her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Taylor wondered where the girl could be walking so fast. But she was
      not walking anywhere, and in half an hour she returned, rosy with her
      swift exercise, but with a spirit as perturbed as when she had set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning at six, when she looked out of her window, there was Monte
      tied to the Taylor's gate. Ah, could he have come the day before, could
      she have found him when she returned from that swift walk of hers!

      XXV. PROGRESS OF THE LOST DOG
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not even an hour's visit that the Virginian was able to pay his
      lady love. But neither had he come a hundred miles to see her. The
      necessities of his wandering work had chanced to bring him close enough
      for a glimpse of her, and this glimpse he took, almost on the wing. For he
      had to rejoin a company of men at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yu' got my letter?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday! I wrote it three weeks ago. Well, yu' got it. This cannot be
      the hour with you that I mentioned. That is coming, and maybe very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could say nothing. Relief she felt, and yet with it something like a
      pang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day does not count,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;except that every time I see you
      counts with me. But this is not the hour that I mentioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What little else was said between them upon this early morning shall be
      told duly. For this visit in its own good time did count momentously,
      though both of them took it lightly while its fleeting minutes passed. He
      returned to her two volumes that she had lent him long ago and with Taylor
      he left a horse which he had brought for her to ride. As a good-by, he put
      a bunch of flowers in her hand. Then he was gone, and she watched him
      going by the thick bushes along the stream. They were pink with wild
      roses; and the meadow-larks, invisible in the grass, like hiding
      choristers, sent up across the empty miles of air their unexpected song.
      Earth and sky had been propitious, could he have stayed; and perhaps one
      portion of her heart had been propitious too. So, as he rode away on
      Monte, she watched him, half chilled by reason, half melted by passion,
      self-thwarted, self-accusing, unresolved. Therefore the days that came for
      her now were all of them unhappy ones, while for him they were filled with
      work well done and with changeless longing.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day it seemed as if a lull was coming, a pause in which he could at
      last attain that hour with her. He left the camp and turned his face
      toward Bear Creek. The way led him along Butte Creek. Across the stream
      lay Balaam's large ranch; and presently on the other bank he saw Balaam
      himself, and reined in Monte for a moment to watch what Balaam was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I've heard,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. For Balaam had led some
      horses to the water, and was lashing them heavily because they would not
      drink. He looked at this spectacle so intently that he did not see Shorty
      approaching along the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; said Shorty to him, with some constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Virginian gave him a pleasant greeting, &ldquo;I was afraid I'd not
      catch you so quick,&rdquo; said Shorty. &ldquo;This is for you.&rdquo; He handed his recent
      foreman a letter of much battered appearance. It was from the Judge. It
      had not come straight, but very gradually, in the pockets of three
      successive cow-punchers. As the Virginian glanced over it and saw that the
      enclosure it contained was for Balaam, his heart fell. Here were new
      orders for him, and he could not go to see his sweetheart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Shorty!&rdquo; said Balaam, from over the creek. To the Virginian he
      gave a slight nod. He did not know him, although he knew well enough who
      he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hyeh's a letter from Judge Henry for yu'&rdquo; said the Virginian, and he
      crossed the creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many weeks before, in the early spring, Balaam had borrowed two horses
      from the Judge, promising to return them at once. But the Judge, of
      course, wrote very civilly. He hoped that &ldquo;this dunning reminder&rdquo; might be
      excused. As Balaam read the reminder, he wished that he had sent the
      horses before. The Judge was a greater man than he in the Territory.
      Balaam could not but excuse the &ldquo;dunning reminder,&rdquo;&mdash;but he was ready
      to be disagreeable to somebody at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, musing aloud in his annoyance, &ldquo;Judge Henry wants them by
      the 30th. Well, this is the 24th, and time enough yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the 27th,&rdquo; said the Virginian, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That made a difference! Not so easy to reach Sunk Creek in good order by
      the 30th! Balaam had drifted three sunrises behind the progress of the
      month. Days look alike, and often lose their very names in the quiet
      depths of Cattle Land. The horses were not even here at the ranch. Balaam
      was ready to be very disagreeable now. Suddenly he perceived the date of
      the Judge's letter. He held it out to the Virginian, and struck the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your idea in bringing this here two weeks late?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when he had struck that paper, Shorty looked at the Virginian. But
      nothing happened beyond a certain change of light in the Southerner's
      eyes. And when the Southerner spoke, it was with his usual gentleness and
      civility. He explained that the letter had been put in his hands just now
      by Shorty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Balaam. He looked at Shorty. How had he come to be a messenger?
      &ldquo;You working for the Sunk Creek outfit again?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Shorty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balaam turned to the Virginian again. &ldquo;How do you expect me to get those
      horses to Sunk Creek by the 30th?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian levelled a lazy eye on Balaam. &ldquo;I ain' doin' any expecting,&rdquo;
       said he. His native dialect was on top to-day. &ldquo;The Judge has friends
      goin' to arrive from New Yawk for a trip across the Basin,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;The
      hawsses are for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Balaam grunted with displeasure, and thought of the sixty or seventy days
      since he had told the Judge he would return the horses at once. He looked
      across at Shorty seated in the shade, and through his uneasy thoughts his
      instinct irrelevantly noted what a good pony the youth rode. It was the
      same animal he had seen once or twice before. But something must be done.
      The Judge's horses were far out on the big range, and must be found and
      driven in, which would take certainly the rest of this day, possibly part
      of the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balaam called to one of his men and gave some sharp orders, emphasizing
      details, and enjoining haste, while the Virginian leaned slightly against
      his horse, with one arm over the saddle, hearing and understanding, but
      not smiling outwardly. The man departed to saddle up for his search on the
      big range, and Balaam resumed the unhitching of his team.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're not working for the Sunk Creek outfit now?&rdquo; he inquired of
      Shorty. He ignored the Virginian. &ldquo;Working for the Goose Egg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Shorty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sand Hill outfit, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Shorty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balaam grinned. He noticed how Shorty's yellow hair stuck through a hole
      in his hat, and how old and battered were Shorty's overalls. Shorty had
      been glad to take a little accidental pay for becoming the bearer of the
      letter which he had delivered to the Virginian. But even that sum was no
      longer in his possession. He had passed through Drybone on his way, and at
      Drybone there had been a game of poker. Shorty's money was now in the
      pocket of Trampas. But he had one valuable possession in the world left to
      him, and that was his horse Pedro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good pony of yours,&rdquo; said Balaam to him now, from across Butte Creek.
      Then he struck his own horse in the jaw because he held back from coming
      to the water as the other had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your trace ain't unhitched,&rdquo; commented the Virginian, pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balaam loosed the strap he had forgotten, and cut the horse again for
      consistency's sake. The animal, bewildered, now came down to the water,
      with its head in the air, and snuffing as it took short, nervous steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian looked on at this, silent and sombre. He could scarcely
      interfere between another man and his own beast. Neither he nor Balaam was
      among those who say their prayers. Yet in this omission they were not
      equal. A half-great poet once had a wholly great day, and in that great
      day he was able to write a poem that has lived and become, with many, a
      household word. He called it The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. And it is
      rich with many lines that possess the memory; but these are the golden
      ones:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;He prayeth well who loveth well
     Both man and bird and beast.

     He prayeth best who loveth best
     All things both great and small;
     For the dear God who loveth us,
     He made and loveth all.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      These lines are the pure gold. They are good to teach children; because
      after the children come to be men, they may believe at least some part of
      them still. The Virginian did not know them,&mdash;but his heart had
      taught him many things. I doubt if Balaam knew them either. But on him
      they would have been as pearls to swine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you've quit the round-up?&rdquo; he resumed to Shorty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shorty nodded and looked sidewise at the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Virginian knew that he had been turned off for going to sleep
      while night-herding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Balaam threw another glance on Pedro the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Shorty!&rdquo; he called out, for the boy was departing. &ldquo;Don't you like
      dinner any more? It's ready about now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shorty forded the creek and slung his saddle off, and on invitation turned
      Pedro, his buckskin pony, into Balaam's pasture. This was green, the rest
      of the wide world being yellow, except only where Butte Creek, with its
      bordering cottonwoods, coiled away into the desert distance like a green
      snake without end. The Virginian also turned his horse into the pasture.
      He must stay at the ranch till the Judge's horses should be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Balaam's East yet,&rdquo; said her lord, leading the way to his dining
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted Shorty to dine with him, and could not exclude the Virginian,
      much as he should have enjoyed this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See any Indians?&rdquo; he enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na-a!&rdquo; said Shorty, in disdain of recent rumors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're headin' the other way,&rdquo; observed the Virginian. &ldquo;Bow Laig Range
      is where they was repawted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business have they got off the reservation, I'd like to know,&rdquo; said
      the ranchman, &ldquo;Bow Leg, or anywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's just a hunt, and a kind of visitin' their friends on the South
      Reservation,&rdquo; Shorty explained. &ldquo;Squaws along and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if the folks at Washington don't keep squaws and all where they
      belong,&rdquo; said Balaam, in a rage, &ldquo;the folks in Wyoming Territory 'ill do a
      little job that way themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a petition out,&rdquo; said Shorty. &ldquo;Paper's goin' East with a lot of
      names to it. But they ain't no harm, them Indians ain't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No harm?&rdquo; rasped out Balaam. &ldquo;Was it white men druv off the O. C.
      yearlings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Balaam's Eastern grammar was sometimes at the mercy of his Western
      feelings. The thought of the perennial stultification of Indian affairs at
      Washington, whether by politician or philanthropist, was always sure to
      arouse him. He walked impatiently about while he spoke, and halted
      impatiently at the window. Out in the world the unclouded day was shining,
      and Balaam's eye travelled across the plains to where a blue line, faint
      and pale, lay along the end of the vast yellow distance. That was the
      beginning of the Bow Leg Mountains. Somewhere over there were the red men,
      ranging in unfrequented depths of rock and pine&mdash;their forbidden
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was ready, and they sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose,&rdquo; Balaam continued, still hot on the subject, &ldquo;you'd claim
      Indians object to killing a white man when they run on to him good and far
      from human help? These peaceable Indians are just the worst in the
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; assented the easy-opinioned Shorty, exactly as if he had
      always maintained this view. &ldquo;Chap started for Sunk Creek three weeks ago.
      Trapper he was; old like, with a red shirt. One of his horses come into
      the round-up Toosday. Man ain't been heard from.&rdquo; He ate in silence for a
      while, evidently brooding in his childlike mind. Then he said,
      querulously, &ldquo;I'd sooner trust one of them Indians than I would Trampas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Balaam slanted his fat bullet head far to one side, and laying his spoon
      down (he had opened some canned grapes) laughed steadily at his guest with
      a harsh relish of irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guest ate a grape, and perceiving he was seen through, smiled back
      rather miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Shorty,&rdquo; said Balaam, his head still slanted over, &ldquo;what's the
      figures of your bank balance just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't usin' banks,&rdquo; murmured the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balaam put some more grapes on Shorty's plate, and drawing a cigar from
      his waistcoat, sent it rolling to his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matches are behind you,&rdquo; he added. He gave a cigar to the Virginian as an
      afterthought, but to his disgust, the Southerner put it in his pocket and
      lighted a pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balaam accompanied his guest, Shorty, when he went to the pasture to
      saddle up and depart. &ldquo;Got a rope?&rdquo; he asked the guest, as they lifted
      down the bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't need to rope him. I can walk right up to Pedro. You stay back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hiding his bridle behind him, Shorty walked to the river-bank, where the
      pony was switching his long tail in the shade; and speaking persuasively
      to him, he came nearer, till he laid his hand on Pedro's dusky mane, which
      was many shades darker than his hide. He turned expectantly, and his
      master came up to his expectations with a piece of bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eats that, does he?&rdquo; said Balaam, over the bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likes the salt,&rdquo; said Shorty. &ldquo;Now, n-n-ow, here! Yu' don't guess yu'll
      be bridled, don't you? Open your teeth! Yu'd like to play yu' was nobody's
      horse and live private? Or maybe yu'd prefer ownin' a saloon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pedro evidently enjoyed this talk, and the dodging he made about the bit.
      Once fairly in his mouth, he accepted the inevitable, and followed Shorty
      to the bars. Then Shorty turned and extended his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shake!&rdquo; he said to his pony, who lifted his forefoot quietly and put it
      in his master's hand. Then the master tickled his nose, and he wrinkled it
      and flattened his ears, pretending to bite. His face wore an expression of
      knowing relish over this performance. &ldquo;Now the other hoof,&rdquo; said Shorty;
      and the horse and master shook hands with their left. &ldquo;I learned him
      that,&rdquo; said the cow-boy, with pride and affection. &ldquo;Say, Pede,&rdquo; he
      continued, in Pedro's ear, &ldquo;ain't yu' the best little horse in the
      country? What? Here, now! Keep out of that, you dead-beat! There ain't no
      more bread.&rdquo; He pinched the pony's nose, one quarter of which was wedged
      into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a lady's little pet!&rdquo; said Balaam, with the rasp in his voice.
      &ldquo;Pity this isn't New York, now, where there's a big market for harmless
      horses. Gee-gees, the children call them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain't no gee-gee,&rdquo; said Shorty, offended. &ldquo;He'll beat any cow-pony
      workin' you've got. Yu' can turn him on a half-dollar. Don't need to touch
      the reins. Hang 'em on one finger and swing your body, and he'll turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Balaam knew this, and he knew that the pony was only a four-year-old.
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Drybone's had no circus this season. Maybe they'd buy
      tickets to see Pedro. He's good for that, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shorty became gloomy. The Virginian was grimly smoking. Here was something
      else going on not to his taste, but none of his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try a circus,&rdquo; persisted Balaam. &ldquo;Alter your plans for spending cash in
      town, and make a little money instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shorty having no plans to alter and no cash to spend, grew still more
      gloomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll you take for that pony?&rdquo; said Balaam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shorty spoke up instantly. &ldquo;A hundred dollars couldn't buy that piece of
      stale mud off his back,&rdquo; he asserted, looking off into the sky
      grandiosely.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Balaam looked at Shorty, &ldquo;You keep the mud,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I'll give
      you thirty dollars for the horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shorty did a little professional laughing, and began to walk toward his
      saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give you thirty dollars,&rdquo; repeated Balaam, picking a stone up and
      slinging it into the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far do yu' call it to Drybone?&rdquo; Shorty remarked, stooping to
      investigate the bucking-strap on his saddle&mdash;a superfluous
      performance, for Pedro never bucked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't have to walk,&rdquo; said Balaam. &ldquo;Stay all night, and I'll send you
      over comfortably in the morning, when the wagon goes for the mail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walk?&rdquo; Shorty retorted. &ldquo;Drybone's twenty-five miles. Pedro'll put me
      there in three hours and not know he done it.&rdquo; He lifted the saddle on the
      horse's back. &ldquo;Come, Pedro,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Pedro!&rdquo; mocked Balaam.
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed a little silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; mumbled Shorty, with his head under Pedro's belly, busily
      cinching. &ldquo;A hundred dollars is bottom figures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Balaam, in his turn, now duly performed some professional laughing, which
      was noted by Shorty under the horse's belly. He stood up and squared round
      on Balaam. &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what'll yu give for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty dollars,&rdquo; said Balaam, looking far off into the sky, as Shorty had
      looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, now,&rdquo; expostulated Shorty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was he who now did the feeling for an offer and this was what Balaam
      liked to see. &ldquo;Why yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thirty,&rdquo; and looked surprised that he
      should have to mention the sum so often.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought yu'd quit them first figures,&rdquo; said the cow-puncher, &ldquo;for yu'
      can see I ain't goin' to look at em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Balaam climbed on the fence and sat there &ldquo;I'm not crying for your Pedro,&rdquo;
       he observed dispassionately. &ldquo;Only it struck me you were dead broke, and
      wanted to raise cash and keep yourself going till you hunted up a job and
      could buy him back.&rdquo; He hooked his right thumb inside his waistcoat
      pocket. &ldquo;But I'm not cryin' for him,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;He'd stay right here,
      of course. I wouldn't part with him. Why does he stand that way? Hello!&rdquo;
       Balaam suddenly straightened himself, like a man who has made a discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, what?&rdquo; said Shorty, on the defensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balaam was staring at Pedro with a judicial frown. Then he stuck out a
      finger at the horse, keeping the thumb hooked in his pocket. So meagre a
      gesture was felt by the ruffled Shorty to be no just way to point at
      Pedro. &ldquo;What's the matter with that foreleg there?&rdquo; said Balaam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which? Nothin's the matter with it!&rdquo; snapped Shorty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balaam climbed down from his fence and came over with elaborate
      deliberation. He passed his hand up and down the off foreleg. Then he spit
      slenderly. &ldquo;Mm!&rdquo; he said thoughtfully; and added, with a shade of sadness,
      &ldquo;that's always to be expected when they're worked too young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shorty slid his hand slowly over the disputed leg. &ldquo;What's to be
      expected?&rdquo; he inquired&mdash;&ldquo;that they'll eat hearty? Well, he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this retort the Virginian permitted himself to laugh in audible
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sprung,&rdquo; continued Balaam, with a sigh. &ldquo;Whirling round short when his
      bones were soft did that. Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sprung!&rdquo; Shorty said, with a bark of indignation. &ldquo;Come on, Pede; you and
      me'll spring for town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught the horn of the saddle, and as he swung into place the horse
      rushed away with him. &ldquo;O-ee! yoi-yup, yup, yup!&rdquo; sang Shorty, in the
      shrill cow dialect. He made Pedro play an exhibition game of speed,
      bringing him round close to Balaam in a wide circle, and then he vanished
      in dust down the left-bank trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balaam looked after him and laughed harshly. He had seen trout dash about
      like that when the hook in their jaw first surprised them. He knew Shorty
      would show the pony off, and he knew Shorty's love for Pedro was not equal
      to his need of money. He called to one of his men, asked something about
      the dam at the mouth of the canyon, where the main irrigation ditch began,
      made a remark about the prolonged drought, and then walked to his
      dining-room door, where, as he expected, Shorty met him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;do you consider that's any way to talk about a
      good horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any dude could see the leg's sprung,&rdquo; said Balaam. But he looked at
      Pedro's shoulder, which was well laid back; and he admired his points,
      dark in contrast with the buckskin, and also the width between the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you know,&rdquo; whined Shorty, &ldquo;that it ain't sprung any more than your
      leg's cork. If you mean the right leg ain't plumb straight, I can tell you
      he was born so. That don't make no difference, for it ain't weak. Try him
      onced. Just as sound and strong as iron. Never stumbles. And he don't
      never go to jumpin' with yu'. He's kind and he's smart.&rdquo; And the master
      petted his pony, who lifted a hoof for another handshake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Balaam had never thought the leg was sprung, and he now took on
      an unprejudiced air of wanting to believe Shorty's statements if he only
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe there's two years' work left in that leg,&rdquo; he now observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better give your hawss away, Shorty,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this your deal, my friend?&rdquo; inquired Balaam. And he slanted his bullet
      head at the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him away, Shorty,&rdquo; drawled the Southerner. &ldquo;His laig is busted. Mr.
      Balaam says so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Balaam's face grew evil with baffled fury. But the Virginian was gravely
      considering Pedro. He, too, was not pleased. But he could not interfere.
      Already he had overstepped the code in these matters. He would have dearly
      liked&mdash;for reasons good and bad, spite and mercy mingled&mdash;to
      have spoiled Balaam's market, to have offered a reasonable or even an
      unreasonable price for Pedro, and taken possession of the horse himself.
      But this might not be. In bets, in card games, in all horse transactions
      and other matters of similar business, a man must take care of himself,
      and wiser onlookers must suppress their wisdom and hold their peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Shorty again had a cigar. He had parted with Pedro for forty
      dollars, a striped Mexican blanket, and a pair of spurs. Undressing over
      in the bunk house, he said to the Virginian, &ldquo;I'll sure buy Pedro back off
      him just as soon as ever I rustle some cash.&rdquo; The Virginian grunted. He
      was thinking he should have to travel hard to get the horses to the Judge
      by the 30th; and below that thought lay his aching disappointment and his
      longing for Bear Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early dawn Shorty sat up among his blankets on the floor of the
      bunk house and saw the various sleepers coiled or sprawled in their beds;
      their breathing had not yet grown restless at the nearing of day. He
      stepped to the door carefully, and saw the crowding blackbirds begin their
      walk and chatter in the mud of the littered and trodden corrals. From
      beyond among the cottonwoods, came continually the smooth unemphatic sound
      of the doves answering each other invisibly; and against the empty ridge
      of the river-bluff lay the moon, no longer shining, for there was
      established a new light through the sky. Pedro stood in the pasture close
      to the bars. The cow-boy slowly closed the door behind him, and sitting
      down on the step, drew his money out and idly handled it, taking no
      comfort just then from its possession. Then he put it back, and after
      dragging on his boots, crossed to the pasture, and held a last talk with
      his pony, brushing the cakes of mud from his hide where he had rolled, and
      passing a lingering hand over his mane. As the sounds of the morning came
      increasingly from tree and plain, Shorty glanced back to see that no one
      was yet out of the cabin, and then put his arms round the horse's neck,
      laying his head against him. For a moment the cow-boy's insignificant face
      was exalted by the emotion he would never have let others see. He hugged
      tight this animal, who was dearer to his heart than anybody in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Pedro,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;good-by.&rdquo; Pedro looked for bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his master, sorrowfully, &ldquo;not any more. Yu' know well I'd give
      it yu' if I had it. You and me didn't figure on this, did we, Pedro?
      Good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hugged his pony again, and got as far as the bars of the pasture, but
      returned once more. &ldquo;Good-by, my little horse, my dear horse, my little,
      little Pedro,&rdquo; he said, as his tears wet the pony's neck. Then he wiped
      them with his hand, and got himself back to the bunk house. After
      breakfast he and his belongings departed to Drybone, and Pedro from his
      field calmly watched this departure; for horses must recognize even less
      than men the black corners that their destinies turn. The pony stopped
      feeding to look at the mail-wagon pass by; but the master sitting in the
      wagon forebore to turn his head.

    <h2>
      XXVI. BALAAM AND PEDRO
    </h2>
    <p>
      Resigned to wait for the Judge's horses, Balaam went into his office this
      dry, bright morning and read nine accumulated newspapers; for he was
      behindhand. Then he rode out on the ditches, and met his man returning
      with the troublesome animals at last. He hastened home and sent for the
      Virginian. He had made a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;those horses are coming. What trail would you take
      over to the Judge's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shortest trail's right through the Bow Laig Mountains,&rdquo; said the foreman,
      in his gentle voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you're right. It's dinner-time. We'll start right afterward. We'll
      make Little Muddy Crossing by sundown, and Sunk Creek to-morrow, and the
      next day'll see us through. Can a wagon get through Sunk Creek Canyon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian smiled. &ldquo;I reckon it can't, seh, and stay resembling a
      wagon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Balaam told them to saddle Pedro and one packhorse, and drive the bunch of
      horses into a corral, roping the Judge's two, who proved extremely wild.
      He had decided to take this journey himself on remembering certain
      politics soon to be rife in Cheyenne. For Judge Henry was indeed a greater
      man than Balaam. This personally conducted return of the horses would
      temper its tardiness, and, moreover, the sight of some New York visitors
      would be a good thing after seven months of no warmer touch with that
      metropolis than the Sunday HERALD, always eight days old when it reached
      the Butte Creek Ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      They forded Butte Creek, and, crossing the well-travelled trail which
      follows down to Drybone, turned their faces toward the uninhabited country
      that began immediately, as the ocean begins off a sandy shore. And as a
      single mast on which no sail is shining stands at the horizon and seems to
      add a loneliness to the surrounding sea, so the long gray line of fence,
      almost a mile away, that ended Balaam's land on this side the creek,
      stretched along the waste ground and added desolation to the plain. No
      solitary watercourse with margin of cottonwoods or willow thickets flowed
      here to stripe the dingy, yellow world with interrupting green, nor were
      cattle to be seen dotting the distance, nor moving objects at all, nor any
      bird in the soundless air. The last gate was shut by the Virginian, who
      looked back at the pleasant trees of the ranch, and then followed on in
      single file across the alkali of No Man's Land.
    </p>
    <p>
      No cloud was in the sky. The desert's grim noon shone sombrely on flat and
      hill. The sagebrush was dull like zinc. Thick heat rose near at hand from
      the caked alkali, and pale heat shrouded the distant peaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were five horses. Balaam led on Pedro, his squat figure stiff in the
      saddle, but solid as a rock, and tilted a little forward, as his habit
      was. One of the Judge's horses came next, a sorrel, dragging back
      continually on the rope by which he was led. After him ambled Balaam's
      wise pack-animal, carrying the light burden of two days' food and lodging.
      She was an old mare who could still go when she chose, but had been
      schooled by the years, and kept the trail, giving no trouble to the
      Virginian who came behind her. He also sat solid as a rock, yet subtly
      bending to the struggles of the wild horse he led, as a steel spring bends
      and balances and resumes its poise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they made but slow time, and when they topped the last dull rise of
      ground and looked down on the long slant of ragged, caked earth to the
      crossing of Little Muddy, with its single tree and few mean bushes, the
      final distance where eyesight ends had deepened to violet from the thin,
      steady blue they had stared at for so many hours, and all heat was gone
      from the universal dryness. The horses drank a long time from the sluggish
      yellow water, and its alkaline taste and warmth were equally welcome to
      the men. They built a little fire, and when supper was ended, smoked but a
      short while and in silence, before they got in the blankets that were
      spread in a smooth place beside the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had picketed the two horses of the Judge in the best grass they could
      find, letting the rest go free to find pasture where they could. When the
      first light came, the Virginian attended to breakfast, while Balaam rode
      away on the sorrel to bring in the loose horses. They had gone far out of
      sight, and when he returned with them, after some two hours, he was on
      Pedro. Pedro was soaking with sweat, and red froth creamed from his mouth.
      The Virginian saw the horses must have been hard to drive in, especially
      after Balaam brought them the wild sorrel as a leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'd kep' ridin' him, 'stead of changin' off on your hawss, they'd
      have behaved quieter,&rdquo; said the foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good seasonable advice,&rdquo; said Balaam, sarcastically. &ldquo;I could have
      told you that now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have told you when you started,&rdquo; said the Virginian, heating the
      coffee for Balaam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balaam was eloquent on the outrageous conduct of the horses. He had come
      up with them evidently striking back for Butte Creek, with the old mare in
      the lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I soon showed her the road she was to go,&rdquo; he said, as he drove them
      now to the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian noticed the slight limp of the mare, and how her pastern was
      cut as if with a stone or the sharp heel of a boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess she'll not be in a hurry to travel except when she's wanted to,&rdquo;
       continued Balaam. He sat down, and sullenly poured himself some coffee.
      &ldquo;We'll be in luck if we make any Sunk Creek this night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on with his breakfast, thinking aloud for the benefit of his
      companion, who made no comments, preferring silence to the discomfort of
      talking with a man whose vindictive humor was so thoroughly uppermost. He
      did not even listen very attentively, but continued his preparations for
      departure, washing the dishes, rolling the blankets, and moving about in
      his usual way of easy and visible good nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six o'clock, already,&rdquo; said Balaam, saddling the horses. &ldquo;And we'll not
      get started for ten minutes more.&rdquo; Then he came to Pedro. &ldquo;So you haven't
      quit fooling yet, haven't you?&rdquo; he exclaimed, for the pony shrank as he
      lifted the bridle. &ldquo;Take that for your sore mouth!&rdquo; and he rammed the bit
      in, at which Pedro flung back and reared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never saw Pedro act that way yet,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, rubbish!&rdquo; said Balaam. &ldquo;They're all the same. Not a bastard one but's
      laying for his chance to do for you. Some'll buck you off, and some'll
      roll with you, and some'll fight you with their fore feet. They may play
      good for a year, but the Western pony's man's enemy, and when he judges
      he's got his chance, he's going to do his best. And if you come out alive
      it won't be his fault.&rdquo; Balaam paused for a while, packing. &ldquo;You've got to
      keep them afraid of you,&rdquo; he said next; &ldquo;that's what you've got to do if
      you don't want trouble. That Pedro horse there has been fed, hand-fed, and
      fooled with like a damn pet, and what's that policy done? Why, he goes
      ugly when he thinks it's time, and decides he'll not drive any horses into
      camp this morning. He knows better now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Balaam,&rdquo; said the Virginian, &ldquo;I'll buy that hawss off yu' right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Balaam shook his head. &ldquo;You'll not do that right now or any other time,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;I happen to want him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian could do no more. He had heard cow-punchers say to
      refractory ponies, &ldquo;You keep still, or I'll Balaam you!&rdquo; and he now
      understood the aptness of the expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Balaam began to lead Pedro to the creek for a last drink before
      starting across the torrid drought. The horse held back on the rein a
      little, and Balaam turned and cut the whip across his forehead. A delay of
      forcing and backing followed, while the Virginian, already in the saddle,
      waited. The minutes passed, and no immediate prospect, apparently, of
      getting nearer Sunk Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain' goin' to follow you while you're beatin' his haid,&rdquo; the
      Southerner at length remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you can teach me anything about horses?&rdquo; retorted Balaam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it don't look like I could,&rdquo; said the Virginian, lazily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don't try it, so long as it's not your horse, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the Southerner levelled his eye on Balaam. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, in
      the same gentle voice. &ldquo;And don't you call me your friend. You've made
      that mistake twiced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The road was shadeless, as it had been from the start, and they could not
      travel fast. During the first few hours all coolness was driven out of the
      glassy morning, and another day of illimitable sun invested the world with
      its blaze. The pale Bow Leg Range was coming nearer, but its hard hot
      slants and rifts suggested no sort of freshness, and even the pines that
      spread for wide miles along near the summit counted for nothing in the
      distance and the glare, but seemed mere patches of dull dry discoloration.
      No talk was exchanged between the two travellers, for the cow-puncher had
      nothing to say and Balaam was sulky, so they moved along in silent
      endurance of each other's company and the tedium of the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the slow succession of rise and fall in the plain changed and
      shortened. The earth's surface became lumpy, rising into mounds and
      knotted systems of steep small hills cut apart by staring gashes of sand,
      where water poured in the spring from the melting snow. After a time they
      ascended through the foot-hills till the plain below was for a while
      concealed, but came again into view in its entirety, distant and a thing
      of the past, while some magpies sailed down to meet them from the new
      country they were entering. They passed up through a small transparent
      forest of dead trees standing stark and white, and a little higher came on
      a line of narrow moisture that crossed the way and formed a stale pool
      among some willow thickets. They turned aside to water their horses, and
      found near the pool a circular spot of ashes and some poles lying, and
      beside these a cage-like edifice of willow wands built in the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indian camp,&rdquo; observed the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were the tracks of five or six horses on the farther side of the
      pool, and they did not come into the trail, but led off among the rocks on
      some system of their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're about a week old,&rdquo; said Balaam. &ldquo;It's part of that outfit that's
      been hunting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've gone on to visit their friends,&rdquo; added the cow-puncher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, on the Southern Reservation. How far do you call Sunk Creek now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Virginian, calculating, &ldquo;it's mighty nigh fo'ty miles
      from Muddy Crossin', an' I reckon we've come eighteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just about. It's noon.&rdquo; Balaam snapped his watch shut. &ldquo;We'll rest here
      till 12:30.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When it was time to go, the Virginian looked musingly at the mountains.
      &ldquo;We'll need to travel right smart to get through the canyon to-night,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; said Balaam; &ldquo;we'll rope the Judge's horses together and
      drive 'em in front of us. That'll make speed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mightn't they get away on us?&rdquo; objected the Virginian. &ldquo;They're pow'ful
      wild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can't get away from me, I guess,&rdquo; said Balaam, and the arrangement
      was adopted. &ldquo;We're the first this season over this piece of the trail,&rdquo;
       he observed presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion had noticed the ground already, and assented. There were no
      tracks anywhere to be seen over which winter had not come and gone since
      they had been made. Presently the trail wound into a sultry gulch that
      hemmed in the heat and seemed to draw down the sun's rays more vertically.
      The sorrel horse chose this place to make a try for liberty. He suddenly
      whirled from the trail, dragging with him his less inventive fellow.
      Leaving the Virginian with the old mare, Balaam headed them off, for Pedro
      was quick, and they came jumping down the bank together, but swiftly
      crossed up on the other side, getting much higher before they could be
      reached. It was no place for this sort of game, as the sides of the ravine
      were ploughed with steep channels, broken with jutting knobs of rock, and
      impeded by short twisted pines that swung out from their roots
      horizontally over the pitch of the hill. The Virginian helped, but used
      his horse with more judgment, keeping as much on the level as possible,
      and endeavoring to anticipate the next turn of the runaways before they
      made it, while Balaam attempted to follow them close, wheeling short when
      they doubled, heavily beating up the face of the slope, veering again to
      come down to the point he had left, and whenever he felt Pedro begin to
      flag, driving his spurs into the horse and forcing him to keep up the
      pace. He had set out to overtake and capture on the side of the mountain
      these two animals who had been running wild for many weeks, and now
      carried no weight but themselves, and the futility of such work could not
      penetrate his obstinate and rising temper. He had made up his mind not to
      give in. The Virginian soon decided to move slowly along for the present,
      preventing the wild horses from passing down the gulch again, but
      otherwise saving his own animal from useless fatigue. He saw that Pedro
      was reeking wet, with mouth open, and constantly stumbling, though he
      galloped on. The cow-puncher kept the group in sight, driving the
      packhorse in front of him, and watching the tactics of the sorrel, who had
      now undoubtedly become the leader of the expedition, and was at the top of
      the gulch, in vain trying to find an outlet through its rocky rim to the
      levels above. He soon judged this to be no thoroughfare, and changing his
      plan, trotted down to the bottom and up the other side, gaining more and
      more; for in this new descent Pedro had fallen twice. Then the sorrel
      showed the cleverness of a genuinely vicious horse. The Virginian saw him
      stop and fall to kicking his companion with all the energy that a short
      rope would permit. The rope slipped, and both, unencumbered, reached the
      top and disappeared. Leaving the packhorse for Balaam, the Virginian
      started after them and came into a high tableland, beyond which the
      mountains began in earnest. The runaways were moving across toward these
      at an easy rate. He followed for a moment, then looking back, and seeing
      no sign of Balaam, waited, for the horses were sure not to go fast when
      they reached good pasture or water.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got out of the saddle and sat on the ground, watching, till the mare
      came up slowly into sight, and Balaam behind her. When they were near,
      Balaam dismounted and struck Pedro fearfully, until the stick broke, and
      he raised the splintered half to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the pony's condition, the Virginian spoke, and said, &ldquo;I'd let that
      hawss alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Balaam turned to him, but wholly possessed by passion did not seem to
      hear, and the Southerner noticed how white and like that of a maniac his
      face was. The stick slid to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He played he was tired,&rdquo; said Balaam, looking at the Virginian with
      glazed eyes. The violence of his rage affected him physically, like some
      stroke of illness. &ldquo;He played out on me on purpose.&rdquo; The man's voice was
      dry and light. &ldquo;He's perfectly fresh now,&rdquo; he continued, and turned again
      to the coughing, swaying horse, whose eyes were closed. Not having the
      stick, he seized the animal's unresisting head and shook it. The Virginian
      watched him a moment, and rose to stop such a spectacle. Then, as if
      conscious he was doing no real hurt, Balaam ceased, and turning again in
      slow fashion looked across the level, where the runaways were still
      visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to take your horse,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;mine's played out on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain' goin' to touch my hawss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the words seemed not entirely to reach Balaam's understanding, so
      dulled by rage were his senses. He made no answer, but mounted Pedro; and
      the failing pony walked mechanically forward, while the Virginian,
      puzzled, stood looking after him. Balaam seemed without purpose of going
      anywhere, and stopped in a moment. Suddenly he was at work at something.
      This sight was odd and new to look at. For a few seconds it had no meaning
      to the Virginian as he watched. Then his mind grasped the horror, too
      late. Even with his cry of execration and the tiger spring that he gave to
      stop Balaam, the monstrosity was wrought. Pedro sank motionless, his head
      rolling flat on the earth. Balaam was jammed beneath him. The man had
      struggled to his feet before the Virginian reached the spot, and the horse
      then lifted his head and turned it piteously round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then vengeance like a blast struck Balaam. The Virginian hurled him to the
      ground, lifted and hurled him again, lifted him and beat his face and
      struck his jaw. The man's strong ox-like fighting availed nothing. He
      fended his eyes as best he could against these sledge-hammer blows of
      justice. He felt blindly for his pistol. That arm was caught and wrenched
      backward, and crushed and doubled. He seemed to hear his own bones, and
      set up a hideous screaming of hate and pain. Then the pistol at last came
      out, and together with the hand that grasped it was instantly stamped into
      the dust. Once again the creature was lifted and slung so that he lay
      across Pedro's saddle a blurred, dingy, wet pulp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vengeance had come and gone. The man and the horse were motionless. Around
      them, silence seemed to gather like a witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are dead,&rdquo; said the Virginian, &ldquo;I am glad of it.&rdquo; He stood looking
      down at Balaam and Pedro, prone in the middle of the open tableland. Then
      he saw Balaam looking at him. It was the quiet stare of sight without
      thought or feeling, the mere visual sense alone, almost frightful in its
      separation from any self. But as he watched those eyes, the self came back
      into them. &ldquo;I have not killed you,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;Well, I ain't
      goin' to do any more to yu'&mdash;if that's a satisfaction to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he began to attend to Balaam with impersonal skill, like some one
      hired for the purpose. &ldquo;He ain't hurt bad,&rdquo; he asserted aloud, as if the
      man were some nameless patient; and then to Balaam he remarked, &ldquo;I reckon
      it might have put a less tough man than you out of business for quite a
      while. I'm goin' to get some water now.&rdquo; When he returned with the water,
      Balsam was sitting up, looking about him. He had not yet spoken, nor did
      he now speak. The sunlight flashed on the six-shooter where it lay, and
      the Virginian secured it. &ldquo;She ain't so pretty as she was,&rdquo; he remarked,
      as he examined the weapon. &ldquo;But she'll go right handy yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strength was in a measure returning to Pedro. He was a young horse, and
      the exhaustion neither of anguish nor of over-riding was enough to affect
      him long or seriously. He got himself on his feet and walked waveringly
      over to the old mare, and stood by her for comfort. The cow-puncher came
      up to him, and Pedro, after starting back slightly, seemed to comprehend
      that he was in friendly hands. It was plain that he would soon be able to
      travel slowly if no weight was on him, and that he would be a very good
      horse again. Whether they abandoned the runaways or not, there was no
      staying here for night to overtake them without food or water. The day was
      still high, and what its next few hours had in store the Virginian could
      not say, and he left them to take care of themselves, determining
      meanwhile that he would take command of the minutes and maintain the
      position he had assumed both as to Balaam and Pedro. He took Pedro's
      saddle off, threw the mare's pack to the ground, put Balaam's saddle on
      her, and on that stowed or tied her original pack, which he could do,
      since it was so light. Then he went to Balaam, who was sitting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you can travel,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;And your hawss can. If
      you're comin' with me, you'll ride your mare. I'm goin' to trail them
      hawsses. If you're not comin' with me, your hawss comes with me, and
      you'll take fifty dollars for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Balaam was indifferent to this good bargain. He did not look at the other
      or speak, but rose and searched about him on the ground. The Virginian was
      also indifferent as to whether Balaam chose to answer or not. Seeing
      Balaam searching the ground, he finished what he had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have your six-shooter, and you'll have it when I'm ready for you to.
      Now, I'm goin',&rdquo; he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balaam's intellect was clear enough now, and he saw that though the rest
      of this journey would be nearly intolerable, it must go on. He looked at
      the impassive cow-puncher getting ready to go and tying a rope on Pedro's
      neck to lead him, then he looked at the mountains where the runaways had
      vanished, and it did not seem credible to him that he had come into such
      straits. He was helped stiffly on the mare, and the three horses in single
      file took up their journey once more, and came slowly among the mountains.
      The perpetual desert was ended, and they crossed a small brook, where they
      missed the trail. The Virginian dismounted to find where the horses had
      turned off, and discovered that they had gone straight up the ridge by the
      watercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's been a man camped in hyeh inside a month,&rdquo; he said, kicking up a
      rag of red flannel. &ldquo;White man and two hawsses. Ours have went up his old
      tracks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not easy for Balaam to speak yet, and he kept his silence. But he
      remembered that Shorty had spoken of a trapper who had started for Sunk
      Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three hours they followed the runaways' course over softer ground, and
      steadily ascending, passed one or two springs, at length, where the mud
      was not yet settled in the hoofprints. Then they came through a corner of
      pine forest and down a sudden bank among quaking-asps to a green park.
      Here the runaways beside a stream were grazing at ease, but saw them
      coming, and started on again, following down the stream. For the present
      all to be done was to keep them in sight. This creek received tributaries
      and widened, making a valley for itself. Above the bottom, lining the
      first terrace of the ridge, began the pines, and stretched back, unbroken
      over intervening summit and basin, to cease at last where the higher peaks
      presided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This hyeh's the middle fork of Sunk Creek,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;We'll
      get on to our right road again where they join.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon a game trail marked itself along the stream. If this would only
      continue, the runaways would be nearly sure to follow it down into the
      canyon. Then there would be no way for them but to go on and come out into
      their own country, where they would make for the Judge's ranch of their
      own accord. The great point was to reach the canyon before dark. They
      passed into permanent shadow; for though the other side of the creek shone
      in full day, the sun had departed behind the ridges immediately above
      them. Coolness filled the air, and the silence, which in this deep valley
      of invading shadow seemed too silent, was relieved by the birds. Not birds
      of song, but a freakish band of gray talkative observers, who came calling
      and croaking along through the pines, and inspected the cavalcade, keeping
      it company for a while, and then flying up into the woods again. The
      travellers came round a corner on a little spread of marsh, and from
      somewhere in the middle of it rose a buzzard and sailed on its black
      pinions into the air above them, wheeling and wheeling, but did not grow
      distant. As it swept over the trail, something fell from its claw, a rag
      of red flannel; and each man in turn looked at it as his horse went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if there's plenty elk and deer hyeh?&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess there is,&rdquo; Balaam replied, speaking at last. The travellers had
      become strangely reconciled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's game 'most all over these mountains,&rdquo; the Virginian continued;
      &ldquo;country not been settled long enough to scare them out.&rdquo; So they fell
      into casual conversation, and for the first time were glad of each other's
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of a new bird came from the pines above&mdash;the hoot of an owl&mdash;and
      was answered from some other part of the wood. This they did not
      particularly notice at first, but soon they heard the same note,
      unexpectedly distant, like an echo. The game trail, now quite a defined
      path beside the river, showed no sign of changing its course or fading out
      into blank ground, as these uncertain guides do so often. It led
      consistently in the desired direction, and the two men were relieved to
      see it continue. Not only were the runaways easier to keep track of, but
      better speed was made along this valley. The pervading imminence of night
      more and more dispelled the lingering afternoon, though there was yet no
      twilight in the open, and the high peaks opposite shone yellow in the
      invisible sun. But now the owls hooted again. Their music had something in
      it that caused both the Virginian and Balaam to look up at the pines and
      wish that this valley would end. Perhaps it was early for night-birds to
      begin; or perhaps it was that the sound never seemed to fall behind, but
      moved abreast of them among the trees above, as they rode on without pause
      down below; some influence made the faces of the travellers grave. The
      spell of evil which the sight of the wheeling buzzard had begun, deepened
      as evening grew, while ever and again along the creek the singular call
      and answer of the owls wandered among the darkness of the trees not far
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was gone from the peaks when at length the other side of the
      stream opened into a long wide meadow. The trail they followed, after
      crossing a flat willow thicket by the water, ran into dense pines, that
      here for the first time reached all the way down to the water's edge. The
      two men came out of the willows, and saw ahead the capricious runaways
      leave the bottom and go up the hill and enter the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must hinder that,&rdquo; said the Virginian; and he dropped Pedro's rope.
      &ldquo;There's your six-shooter. You keep the trail, and camp down there&rdquo;&mdash;he
      pointed to where the trees came to the water&mdash;&ldquo;till I head them
      hawsses off. I may not get back right away.&rdquo; He galloped up the open hill
      and went into the pine, choosing a place above where the vagrants had
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balaam dismounted, and picking up his six-shooter, took the rope off
      Pedro's neck and drove him slowly down toward where the wood began. Its
      interior was already dim, and Balaam saw that here must be their
      stopping-place to-night, since there was no telling how wide this pine
      strip might extend along the trail before they could come out of it and
      reach another suitable camping-ground. Pedro had recovered his strength,
      and he now showed signs of restlessness. He shied where there was not even
      a stone in the trail, and finally turned sharply round. Balaam expected he
      was going to rush back on the way they had come; but the horse stood
      still, breathing excitedly. He was urged forward again, though he turned
      more than once. But when they were a few paces from the wood, and Balaam
      had got off preparatory to camping, the horse snorted and dashed into the
      water, and stood still there. The astonished Balaam followed to turn him;
      but Pedro seemed to lose control of himself, and plunged to the middle of
      the river, and was evidently intending to cross. Fearing that he would
      escape to the opposite meadow and add to their difficulties, Balaam, with
      the idea of turning him round, drew his six-shooter and fired in front of
      the horse, divining, even as the flash cut the dusk, the secret of all
      this&mdash;the Indians; but too late. His bruised hand had stiffened,
      marring his aim, and he saw Pedro fall over in the water then rise and
      struggle up the bank on the farther shore, where he now hurried also, to
      find that he had broken the pony's leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      He needed no interpreter for the voices of the seeming owls that had
      haunted the latter hour of their journey, and he knew that his beast's
      keener instinct had perceived the destruction that lurked in the interior
      of the wood. The history of the trapper whose horse had returned without
      him might have been&mdash;might still be&mdash;his own; and he thought of
      the rag that had fallen from the buzzard's talons when he had been
      disturbed at his meal in the marsh. &ldquo;Peaceable&rdquo; Indians were still in
      these mountains, and some few of them had for the past hour been skirting
      his journey unseen, and now waited for him in the wood which they expected
      him to enter. They had been too wary to use their rifles or show
      themselves, lest these travellers should be only part of a larger company
      following, who would hear the noise of a shot, and catch them in the act
      of murder. So, safe under the cover of the pines, they had planned to
      sling their silent noose, and drag the white man from his horse as he
      passed through the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balaam looked over the river at the ominous wood, and then he looked at
      Pedro, the horse that he had first maimed and now ruined, to whom he
      probably owed his life. He was lying on the ground, quietly looking over
      the green meadow, where dusk was gathering. Perhaps he was not suffering
      from his wound yet, as he rested on the ground; and into his animal
      intelligence there probably came no knowledge of this final stroke of his
      fate. At any rate, no sound of pain came from Pedro, whose friendly and
      gentle face remained turned toward the meadow. Once more Balaam fired his
      pistol, and this time the aim was true, and the horse rolled over, with a
      ball through his brain. It was the best reward that remained for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Balaam rejoined the old mare, and turned from the middle fork of Sunk
      Creek. He dashed across the wide field, and went over a ridge, and found
      his way along in the night till he came to the old trail&mdash;the road
      which they would never have left but for him and his obstinacy. He
      unsaddled the weary mare by Sunk Creek, where the canyon begins, letting
      her drag a rope and find pasture and water, while he, lighting no fire to
      betray him, crouched close under a tree till the light came. He thought of
      the Virginian in the wood. But what could either have done for the other
      had he stayed to look for him among the pines? If the cow-puncher came
      back to the corner, he would follow Balaam's tracks or not. They would
      meet, at any rate, where the creeks joined.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they did not meet. And then to Balaam the prospect of going onward to
      the Sunk Creek Ranch became more than he could bear. To come without the
      horses, to meet Judge Henry, to meet the guests of the Judge's, looking as
      he did now after his punishment by the Virginian, to give the news about
      the Judge's favorite man&mdash;no, how could he tell such a story as this?
      Balaam went no farther than a certain cabin, where he slept, and wrote a
      letter to the Judge. This the owner of the cabin delivered. And so, having
      spread news which would at once cause a search for the Virginian, and
      having constructed such sentences to the Judge as would most smoothly
      explain how, being overtaken by illness, he had not wished to be a burden
      at Sunk Creek, Balaam turned homeward by himself. By the time he was once
      more at Butte Creek, his general appearance was a thing less to be
      noticed. And there was Shorty, waiting!
    </p>
    <p>
      One way and another, the lost dog had been able to gather some ready
      money. He was cheerful because of this momentary purseful of prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I come back, yu' see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For I figured on getting Pedro
      back as soon as I could when I sold him to yu'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're behind the times, Shorty,&rdquo; said Balaam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shorty looked blank. &ldquo;You've sure not sold Pedro?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them Indians,&rdquo; said Balaam, &ldquo;got after me on the Bow Leg trail. Got after
      me and that Virginia man. But they didn't get me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Balaam wagged his bullet head to imply that this escape was due to his own
      superior intelligence. The Virginian had been stupid, and so the Indians
      had got him. &ldquo;And they shot your horse,&rdquo; Balaam finished. &ldquo;Stop and get
      some dinner with the boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having eaten, Shorty rode away in mournful spirits. For he had made so
      sure of once more riding and talking with Pedro, his friend whom he had
      taught to shake hands.

    <h2>
      XXVII. GRANDMOTHER STARK
    </h2>
    <p>
      Except for its chair and bed, the cabin was stripped almost bare. Amid its
      emptiness of dismantled shelves and walls and floor, only the tiny
      ancestress still hung in her place, last token of the home that had been.
      This miniature, tacked against the despoiled boards, and its descendant,
      the angry girl with her hand on an open box-lid, made a sort of couple in
      the loneliness: she on the wall sweet and serene, she by the box sweet and
      stormy. The picture was her final treasure waiting to be packed for the
      journey. In whatever room she had called her own since childhood, there it
      had also lived and looked at her, not quite familiar, not quite smiling,
      but in its prim colonial hues delicate as some pressed flower. Its pale
      oval, of color blue and rose and flaxen, in a battered, pretty gold frame,
      unconquerably pervaded any surroundings with a something like last year's
      lavender. Till yesterday a Crow Indian war-bonnet had hung next it, a
      sumptuous cascade of feathers; on the other side a bow with arrows had
      dangled; opposite had been the skin of a silver fox; over the door had
      spread the antlers of a black-tail deer; a bearskin stretched beneath it.
      Thus had the whole cosey log cabin been upholstered, lavish with trophies
      of the frontier; and yet it was in front of the miniature that the
      visitors used to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shining quietly now in the cabin's blackness this summer day, the heirloom
      was presiding until the end. And as Molly Wood's eyes fell upon her
      ancestress of Bennington, 1777, there flashed a spark of steel in them,
      alone here in the room that she was leaving forever. She was not going to
      teach school any more on Bear Creek, Wyoming; she was going home to
      Bennington, Vermont. When time came for school to open again, there should
      be a new schoolmarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the momentous result of that visit which the Virginian had paid
      her. He had told her that he was coming for his hour soon. From that hour
      she had decided to escape. She was running away from her own heart. She
      did not dare to trust herself face to face again with her potent,
      indomitable lover. She longed for him, and therefore she would never see
      him again. No great-aunt at Dunbarton, or anybody else that knew her and
      her family, should ever say that she had married below her station, had
      been an unworthy Stark! Accordingly, she had written to the Virginian,
      bidding him good-by, and wishing him everything in the world. As she
      happened to be aware that she was taking everything in the world away from
      him, this letter was not the most easy of letters to write. But she had
      made the language very kind. Yes; it was a thoroughly kind communication.
      And all because of that momentary visit, when he had brought back to her
      two novels, EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like them?&rdquo; she had then inquired; and he had smiled slowly at
      her. &ldquo;You haven't read them!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to tell me there has been no time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Molly had scolded her cow-puncher, and to this he had listened with
      pleasure undisguised, as indeed he listened to every word that she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it has come too late,&rdquo; he had told her when the scolding was over.
      &ldquo;If I was one of your little scholars hyeh in Bear Creek schoolhouse, yu'
      could learn me to like such frillery I reckon. But I'm a mighty ignorant,
      growed-up man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse for you!&rdquo; said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I am pretty glad I am a man. Else I could not have learned the thing
      you have taught me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she shut her lips and looked away. On the desk was a letter written
      from Vermont. &ldquo;If you don't tell me at once when you decide,&rdquo; had said the
      arch writer, &ldquo;never hope to speak to me again. Mary Wood, seriously, I am
      suspicious. Why do you never mention him nowadays? How exciting to have
      you bring a live cow-boy to Bennington! We should all come to dinner.
      Though of course I understand now that many of them have excellent
      manners. But would he wear his pistol at table?&rdquo; So the letter ran on. It
      recounted the latest home gossip and jokes. In answering it Molly Wood had
      taken no notice of its childish tone here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hyeh's some of them cactus blossoms yu' wanted,&rdquo; said the Virginian. His
      voice recalled the girl with almost a start. &ldquo;I've brought a good hawss
      I've gentled for yu', and Taylor'll keep him till I need him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you so much! but I wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon yu' can't stop me lendin' Taylor a hawss. And you cert'nly'll
      get sick schoolteachin' if yu' don't keep outdoors some. Good-by&mdash;till
      that next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; there's always a next time,&rdquo; she answered, as lightly as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There always will be. Don't yu' know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have discouraged spells,&rdquo; he pursued, &ldquo;but I down them. For I've told
      yu' you were going to love me. You are goin' to learn back the thing you
      have taught me. I'm not askin' anything now; I don't want you to speak a
      word to me. But I'm never goin' to quit till 'next time' is no more, and
      it's 'all the time' for you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he had ridden away, not even touching her hand. Long after he
      had gone she was still in her chair, her eyes lingering upon his flowers,
      those yellow cups of the prickly pear. At length she had risen
      impatiently, caught up the flowers, gone with them to the open window,&mdash;and
      then, after all, set them with pains in water.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to-day Bear Creek was over. She was going home now. By the week's end
      she would be started. By the time the mail brought him her good-by letter
      she would be gone. She had acted.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Bear Creek, the neighborly, the friendly, the not comprehending, this
      move had come unlooked for, and had brought regret. Only one hard word had
      been spoken to Molly, and that by her next-door neighbor and kindest
      friend. In Mrs. Taylor's house the girl had daily come and gone as a
      daughter, and that lady reached the subject thus:&mdash; &ldquo;When I took
      Taylor,&rdquo; said she, sitting by as Robert Browning and Jane Austen were
      going into their box, &ldquo;I married for love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish it had been money?&rdquo; said Molly, stooping to her industries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know both of us better than that, child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I've seen people at home who couldn't possibly have had any other
      reason. They seemed satisfied, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe the poor ignorant things were!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I have never been sure how I might choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are sure, deary. Don't you think I know you? And when it comes
      over Taylor once in a while, and he tells me I'm the best thing in his
      life, and I tell him he ain't merely the best thing but the only thing in
      mine,&mdash;him and the children,&mdash;why, we just agree we'd do it all
      over the same way if we had the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly continued to be industrious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's why,&rdquo; said Mrs. Taylor, &ldquo;I want every girl that's anything to
      me to know her luck when it comes. For I was that near telling Taylor I
      wouldn't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever my luck comes,&rdquo; said Molly, with her back to her friend, &ldquo;I shall
      say 'I will' at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll say it at Bennington next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly wheeled round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you surely will. Do you expect he's going to stay here, and you in
      Bennington?&rdquo; And the campaigner sat back in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He? Goodness! Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child, child, you're talking cross to-day because you're at outs with
      yourself. You've been at outs ever since you took this idea of leaving the
      school and us and everything this needless way. You have not treated him
      right. And why, I can't make out to save me. What have you found out all
      of a sudden? If he was not good enough for you, I&mdash;But, oh, it's a
      prime one you're losing, Molly. When a man like that stays faithful to a
      girl 'spite all the chances he gets, her luck is come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my luck! People have different notions of luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Notions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been very kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind!&rdquo; And now without further simmering, Mrs. Taylor's wrath boiled up
      and poured copiously over Molly Wood. &ldquo;Kind! There's a word you shouldn't
      use, my dear. No doubt you can spell it. But more than its spelling I
      guess you don't know. The children can learn what it means from some of
      the rest of us folks that don't spell so correct, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Taylor, Mrs. Taylor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't wait, deary. Since the roughness looks bigger to you than the
      diamond, you had better go back to Vermont. I expect you'll find better
      grammar there, deary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good dame stalked out, and across to her own cabin, and left the angry
      girl among her boxes. It was in vain she fell to work upon them. Presently
      something had to be done over again, and when it was the box held several
      chattels less than before the readjustment. She played a sort of desperate
      dominos to fit these objects in the space, but here were a paper-weight, a
      portfolio, with two wretched volumes that no chink would harbor; and
      letting them fall all at once, she straightened herself, still stormy with
      revolt, eyes and cheeks still hot from the sting of long-parried truth.
      There, on her wall still, was the miniature, the little silent ancestress;
      and upon this face the girl's glance rested. It was as if she appealed to
      Grandmother Stark for support and comfort across the hundred years which
      lay between them. So the flaxen girl on the wall and she among the boxes
      stood a moment face to face in seeming communion, and then the descendant
      turned again to her work. But after a desultory touch here and there she
      drew a long breath and walked to the open door. What use was in finishing
      to-day, when she had nearly a week? This first spurt of toil had swept the
      cabin bare of all indwelling charm, and its look was chill. Across the
      lane his horse, the one he had &ldquo;gentled&rdquo; for her, was grazing idly. She
      walked there and caught him, and led him to her gate. Mrs. Taylor saw her
      go in, and soon come out in riding-dress; and she watched the girl throw
      the saddle on with quick ease&mdash;the ease he had taught her. Mrs.
      Taylor also saw the sharp cut she gave the horse, and laughed grimly to
      herself in her window as horse and rider galloped into the beautiful sunny
      loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the punished animal this switching was new! and at its third repetition
      he turned his head in surprise, but was no more heeded than were the
      bluffs and flowers where he was taking his own undirected choice of way.
      He carried her over ground she knew by heart&mdash;Corncliff Mesa,
      Crowheart Butte, Westfall's Crossing, Upper Canyon; open land and
      woodland, pines and sage-brush, all silent and grave and lustrous in the
      sunshine. Once and again a ranchman greeted her, and wondered if she had
      forgotten who he was; once she passed some cow-punchers with a small herd
      of steers, and they stared after her too. Bear Creek narrowed, its
      mountain-sides drew near, its little falls began to rush white in midday
      shadow, and the horse suddenly pricked his ears. Unguided, he was taking
      this advantage to go home. Though he had made but little way&mdash;a mere
      beginning yet&mdash;on this trail over to Sunk Creek, here was already a
      Sunk Creek friend whinnying good day to him, so he whinnied back and
      quickened his pace, and Molly started to life. What was Monte doing here?
      She saw the black horse she knew also, saddled, with reins dragging on the
      trail as the rider had dropped them to dismount. A cold spring bubbled out
      beyond the next rock, and she knew her lover's horse was waiting for him
      while he drank. She pulled at the reins, but loosed them, for to turn and
      escape now was ridiculous; and riding boldly round the rock, she came upon
      him by the spring. One of his arms hung up to its elbow in the pool, the
      other was crooked beside his head, but the face was sunk downward against
      the shelving rock, so that she saw only his black, tangled hair. As her
      horse snorted and tossed his head she looked swiftly at Monte, as if to
      question him. Seeing now the sweat matted on his coat, and noting the
      white rim of his eye, she sprang and ran to the motionless figure. A patch
      of blood at his shoulder behind stained the soft flannel shirt, spreading
      down beneath his belt, and the man's whole strong body lay slack and
      pitifully helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched the hand beside his head, but it seemed neither warm nor cold
      to her; she felt for the pulse, as nearly as she could remember the
      doctors did, but could not tell whether she imagined or not that it was
      still; twice with painful care her fingers sought and waited for the beat,
      and her face seemed like one of listening. She leaned down and lifted his
      other arm and hand from the water, and as their ice-coldness reached her
      senses, clearly she saw the patch near the shoulder she had moved grow wet
      with new blood, and at that sight she grasped at the stones upon which she
      herself now sank. She held tight by two rocks, sitting straight beside
      him, staring, and murmuring aloud, &ldquo;I must not faint; I will not faint;&rdquo;
       and the standing horses looked at her, pricking their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this cup-like spread of the ravine the sun shone warmly down, the tall
      red cliff was warm, the pines were a warm film and filter of green;
      outside the shade across Bear Creek rose the steep, soft, open yellow
      hill, warm and high to the blue, and Bear Creek tumbled upon its
      sunsparkling stones. The two horses on the margin trail still looked at
      the spring and trees, where sat the neat flaxen girl so rigid by the slack
      prone body in its flannel shirt and leathern chaps. Suddenly her face
      livened. &ldquo;But the blood ran!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as if to the horses, her
      companions in this. She moved to him, and put her hand in through his
      shirt against his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next moment she had sprung up and was at his saddle, searching, then
      swiftly went on to her own and got her small flask and was back beside
      him. Here was the cold water he had sought, and she put it against his
      forehead and drenched the wounded shoulder with it. Three times she tried
      to move him, so he might lie more easy, but his dead weight was too much,
      and desisting, she sat close and raised his head to let it rest against
      her. Thus she saw the blood that was running from in front of the shoulder
      also; but she said no more about fainting. She tore strips from her dress
      and soaked them, keeping them cold and wet upon both openings of his
      wound, and she drew her pocket-knife out and cut his shirt away from the
      place. As she continually rinsed and cleaned it, she watched his
      eyelashes, long and soft and thick, but they did not stir. Again she tried
      the flask, but failed from being still too gentle, and her searching eyes
      fell upon ashes near the pool. Still undispersed by the weather lay the
      small charred ends of a fire he and she had made once here together, to
      boil coffee and fry trout. She built another fire now, and when the flames
      were going well, filled her flask-cup from the spring and set it to heat.
      Meanwhile, she returned to nurse his head and wound. Her cold water had
      stopped the bleeding. Then she poured her brandy in the steaming cup, and,
      made rough by her desperate helplessness, forced some between his lips and
      teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly, almost, she felt the tremble of life creeping back, and as his
      deep eyes opened upon her she sat still and mute. But the gaze seemed
      luminous with an unnoting calm, and she wondered if perhaps he could not
      recognize her; she watched this internal clearness of his vision, scarcely
      daring to breathe, until presently he began to speak, with the same
      profound and clear impersonality sounding in his slowly uttered words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought they had found me. I expected they were going to kill me.&rdquo; He
      stopped, and she gave him more of the hot drink, which he took, still
      lying and looking at her as if the present did not reach his senses. &ldquo;I
      knew hands were touching me. I reckon I was not dead. I knew about them
      soon as they began, only I could not interfere.&rdquo; He waited again. &ldquo;It is
      mighty strange where I have been. No. Mighty natural.&rdquo; Then he went back
      into his revery, and lay with his eyes still full open upon her where she
      sat motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to feel a greater awe in this living presence than when it had
      been his body with an ice-cold hand; and she quietly spoke his name,
      venturing scarcely more than a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, some nearer thing wakened in his look. &ldquo;But it was you all
      along,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;It is you now. You must not stay&mdash;&rdquo; Weakness
      overcame him, and his eyes closed. She sat ministering to him, and when he
      roused again, he began anxiously at once: &ldquo;You must not stay. They would
      get you, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him with a sort of fierceness, then reached for his pistol,
      in which was nothing but blackened empty cartridges. She threw these out
      and drew six from his belt, loaded the weapon, and snapped shut its hinge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please take it,&rdquo; he said, more anxious and more himself. &ldquo;I ain't worth
      tryin' to keep. Look at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you giving up?&rdquo; she inquired, trying to put scorn in her tone. Then
      she seated herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the sense in both of us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better save your strength,&rdquo; she interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to sit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie down!&rdquo; she ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank obediently, and began to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she saw that, she smiled too, and unexpectedly took his hand.
      &ldquo;Listen, friend,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Nobody shall get you, and nobody shall get
      me. Now take some more brandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be noon,&rdquo; said the cow-puncher, when she had drawn her hand away
      from him. &ldquo;I remember it was dark when&mdash;when&mdash;when I can
      remember. I reckon they were scared to follow me in so close to settlers.
      Else they would have been here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must rest,&rdquo; she observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke the soft ends of some evergreen, and putting them beneath his
      head, went to the horses, loosened the cinches, took off the bridles, led
      them to drink, and picketed them to feed. Further still, to leave nothing
      undone which she could herself manage, she took the horses' saddles off to
      refold the blankets when the time should come, and meanwhile brought them
      for him. But he put them away from him. He was sitting up against a rock,
      stronger evidently, and asking for cold water. His head was fire-hot, and
      the paleness beneath his swarthy skin had changed to a deepening flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only five miles!&rdquo; she said to him, bathing his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I must hold it steady,&rdquo; he answered, waving his hand at the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told him to try and keep it steady until they got home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Only five miles. But it's fightin' to turn around.&rdquo;
       Half aware that he was becoming light-headed, he looked from the rock to
      her and from her to the rock with dilating eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can hold it together,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You must get on your horse.&rdquo; She
      took his handkerchief from round his neck, knotting it with her own, and
      to make more bandage she ran to the roll of clothes behind his saddle and
      tore in halves a clean shirt. A handkerchief fell from it, which she
      seized also, and opening, saw her own initials by the hem. Then she
      remembered: she saw again their first meeting, the swollen river, the
      overset stage, the unknown horseman who carried her to the bank on his
      saddle and went away unthanked&mdash;her whole first adventure on that
      first day of her coming to this new country&mdash;and now she knew how her
      long-forgotten handkerchief had gone that day. She refolded it gently and
      put it back in his bundle, for there was enough bandage without it. She
      said not a word to him, and he placed a wrong meaning upon the look which
      she gave him as she returned to bind his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't hurt so much,&rdquo; he assured her (though extreme pain was clearing
      his head for the moment, and he had been able to hold the cliff from
      turning). &ldquo;Yu' must not squander your pity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not squander your strength,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I could put up a pretty good fight now!&rdquo; But he tottered in showing
      her how strong he was, and she told him that, after all, he was a child
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he slowly said, looking after her as she went to bring his horse,
      &ldquo;the same child that wanted to touch the moon, I guess.&rdquo; And during the
      slow climb down into the saddle from a rock to which she helped him he
      said, &ldquo;You have got to be the man all through this mess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw his teeth clinched and his drooping muscles compelled by will; and
      as he rode and she walked to lend him support, leading her horse by a
      backward-stretched left hand, she counted off the distance to him
      continually&mdash;the increasing gain, the lessening road, the landmarks
      nearing and dropping behind; here was the tree with the wasp-nest gone;
      now the burned cabin was passed; now the cottonwoods at the ford were in
      sight. He was silent, and held to the saddle-horn, leaning more and more
      against his two hands clasped over it; and just after they had made the
      crossing he fell, without a sound slipping to the grass, and his descent
      broken by her. But it started the blood a little, and she dared not leave
      him to seek help. She gave him the last of the flask and all the water he
      craved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Revived, he managed to smile. &ldquo;Yu' see, I ain't worth keeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only a mile,&rdquo; said she. So she found a log, a fallen trunk, and he
      crawled to that, and from there crawled to his saddle, and she marched on
      with him, talking, bidding him note the steps accomplished. For the next
      half-mile they went thus, the silent man clinched on the horse, and by his
      side the girl walking and cheering him forward, when suddenly he began to
      speak:&mdash; &ldquo;I will say good-by to you now, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not understand, at first, the significance of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is getting away,&rdquo; pursued the Virginian. &ldquo;I must ask you to excuse me,
      ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a long while since her lord had addressed her as &ldquo;ma'am.&rdquo; As she
      looked at him in growing apprehension, he turned Monte and would have
      ridden away, but she caught the bridle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take me home,&rdquo; said she, with ready inspiration. &ldquo;I am afraid of
      the Indians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you&mdash;why, they've all gone. There he goes. Ma'am&mdash;that
      hawss&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, holding firmly his rein and quickening her step. &ldquo;A
      gentleman does not invite a lady to go out riding and leave her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes lost their purpose. &ldquo;I'll cert'nly take you home. That sorrel has
      gone in there by the wallow, and Judge Henry will understand.&rdquo; With his
      eyes watching imaginary objects, he rode and rambled and it was now the
      girl who was silent, except to keep his mind from its half-fixed idea of
      the sorrel. As he grew more fluent she hastened still more, listening to
      head off that notion of return, skilfully inventing questions to engage
      him, so that when she brought him to her gate she held him in a manner
      subjected, answering faithfully the shrewd unrealities which she devised,
      whatever makeshifts she could summon to her mind; and next she had got him
      inside her dwelling and set him down docile, but now completely wandering;
      and then&mdash;no help was at hand, even here. She had made sure of aid
      from next door, and there she hastened, to find the Taylor's cabin locked
      and silent; and this meant that parents and children were gone to drive;
      nor might she be luckier at her next nearest neighbors', should she travel
      the intervening mile to fetch them. With a mind jostled once more into
      uncertainty, she returned to her room, and saw a change in him already.
      Illness had stridden upon him; his face was not as she had left it, and
      the whole body, the splendid supple horseman, showed sickness in every
      line and limb, its spurs and pistol and bold leather chaps a mockery of
      trappings. She looked at him, and decision came back to her, clear and
      steady. She supported him over to her bed and laid him on it. His head
      sank flat, and his loose, nerveless arms stayed as she left them. Then
      among her packing-boxes and beneath the little miniature, blue and flaxen
      and gold upon its lonely wall, she undressed him. He was cold, and she
      covered him to the face, and arranged the pillow, and got from its box her
      scarlet and black Navajo blanket and spread it over him. There was no more
      that she could do, and she sat down by him to wait. Among the many and
      many things that came into her mind was a word he said to her lightly a
      long while ago. &ldquo;Cow-punchers do not live long enough to get old,&rdquo; he had
      told her. And now she looked at the head upon the pillow, grave and
      strong, but still the head of splendid, unworn youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the distant jingle of the wagon in the lane she was out, and had met
      her returning neighbors midway. They heard her with amazement, and came in
      haste to the bedside; then Taylor departed to spread news of the Indians
      and bring the doctor, twenty-five miles away. The two women friends stood
      alone again, as they had stood in the morning when anger had been between
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me, deary,&rdquo; said Mrs. Taylor. &ldquo;Now I will look after him&mdash;and
      you'll need some looking after yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But on returning from her cabin with what store she possessed of lint and
      stimulants, she encountered a rebel, independent as ever. Molly would hear
      no talk about saving her strength, would not be in any room but this one
      until the doctor should arrive; then perhaps it would be time to think
      about resting. So together the dame and the girl rinsed the man's wound
      and wrapped him in clean things, and did all the little that they knew&mdash;which
      was, in truth, the very thing needed. Then they sat watching him toss and
      mutter. It was no longer upon Indians or the sorrel horse that his talk
      seemed to run, or anything recent, apparently, always excepting his work.
      This flowingly merged with whatever scene he was inventing or living
      again, and he wandered unendingly in that incompatible world we dream in.
      Through the medley of events and names, often thickly spoken, but rising
      at times to grotesque coherence, the listeners now and then could piece
      out the reference from their own knowledge. &ldquo;Monte,&rdquo; for example,
      continually addressed, and Molly heard her own name, but invariably as
      &ldquo;Miss Wood&rdquo;; nothing less respectful came out, and frequently he answered
      some one as &ldquo;ma'am.&rdquo; At these fragments of revelation Mrs. Taylor
      abstained from speech, but eyed Molly Wood with caustic reproach. As the
      night wore on, short lulls of silence intervened, and the watchers were
      deceived into hope that the fever was abating. And when the Virginian sat
      quietly up in bed, essayed to move his bandage, and looked steadily at
      Mrs. Taylor, she rose quickly and went to him with a question as to how he
      was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise on your laigs, you polecat,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and tell them you're a liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good dame gasped, then bade him lie down, and he obeyed her with that
      strange double understanding of the delirious; for even while submitting,
      he muttered &ldquo;liar,&rdquo; &ldquo;polecat,&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Trampas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that name light flashed on Mrs. Taylor, and she turned to Molly; and
      there was the girl struggling with a fit of mirth at his speech; but the
      laughter was fast becoming a painful seizure. Mrs. Taylor walked Molly up
      and down, speaking mmediately to arrest her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might as well know it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He would blame me for speaking of
      it, but where's the harm all this while after? And you would never hear it
      from his mouth. Molly, child, they say Trampas would kill him if he dared,
      and that's on account of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw Trampas,&rdquo; said Molly, fixing her eyes upon the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, deary. But before a lot of men&mdash;Taylor has told me about it&mdash;Trampas
      spoke disrespectfully of you, and before them all he made Trampas say he
      was a liar. That is what he did when you were almost a stranger among us,
      and he had not started seeing so much of you. I expect Trampas is the only
      enemy he ever had in this country. But he would never let you know about
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; whispered Molly; &ldquo;I did not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steve!&rdquo; the sick man now cried out, in poignant appeal. &ldquo;Steve!&rdquo; To the
      women it was a name unknown,&mdash;unknown as was also this deep inward
      tide of feeling which he could no longer conceal, being himself no longer.
      &ldquo;No, Steve,&rdquo; he said next, and muttering followed. &ldquo;It ain't so!&rdquo; he
      shouted; and then cunningly in a lowered voice, &ldquo;Steve, I have lied for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In time Mrs. Taylor spoke some advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go to bed, child. You look about ready for the doctor
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will wait for him,&rdquo; said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the two nurses continued to sit until darkness at the windows weakened
      into gray, and the lamp was no more needed. Their patient was rambling
      again. Yet, into whatever scenes he went, there in some guise did the
      throb of his pain evidently follow him, and he lay hitching his great
      shoulder as if to rid it of the cumbrance. They waited for the doctor, not
      daring much more than to turn pillows and give what other ease they could;
      and then, instead of the doctor, came a messenger, about noon, to say he
      was gone on a visit some thirty miles beyond, where Taylor had followed to
      bring him here as soon as might be. At this Molly consented to rest and to
      watch, turn about; and once she was over in her friend's house lying down,
      they tried to keep her there. But the revolutionist could not be put down,
      and when, as a last pretext, Mrs. Taylor urged the proprieties and
      conventions, the pale girl from Vermont laughed sweetly in her face and
      returned to sit by the sick man. With the approach of the second night his
      fever seemed to rise and master him more completely than they had yet seen
      it, and presently it so raged that the women called in stronger arms to
      hold him down. There were times when he broke out in the language of the
      round-up, and Mrs. Taylor renewed her protests. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Molly, &ldquo;don't
      you suppose I knew they could swear?&rdquo; So the dame, in deepening
      astonishment and affection, gave up these shifts at decorum. Nor did the
      delirium run into the intimate, coarse matters that she dreaded. The
      cow-puncher had lived like his kind, but his natural daily thoughts were
      clean, and came from the untamed but unstained mind of a man. And toward
      morning, as Mrs. Taylor sat taking her turn, suddenly he asked had he been
      sick long, and looked at her with a quieted eye. The wandering seemed to
      drop from him at a stroke, leaving him altogether himself. He lay very
      feeble, and inquired once or twice of his state and how he came here; nor
      was anything left in his memory of even coming to the spring where he had
      been found.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the doctor arrived, he pronounced that it would be long&mdash;or very
      short. He praised their clean water treatment; the wound was fortunately
      well up on the shoulder, and gave so far no bad signs; there were not any
      bad signs; and the blood and strength of the patient had been as few men's
      were; each hour was now an hour nearer certainty, and meanwhile&mdash;meanwhile
      the doctor would remain as long as he could. He had many inquiries to
      satisfy. Dusty fellows would ride up, listen to him, and reply, as they
      rode away, &ldquo;Don't yu' let him die, Doc.&rdquo; And Judge Henry sent over from
      Sunk Creek to answer for any attendance or medicine that might help his
      foreman. The country was moved with concern and interest; and in Molly's
      ears its words of good feeling seemed to unite and sum up a burden, &ldquo;Don't
      yu' let him die, Doc.&rdquo; The Indians who had done this were now in military
      custody. They had come unpermitted from a southern reservation, hunting,
      next thieving, and as the slumbering spirit roused in one or two of the
      young and ambitious, they had ventured this in the secret mountains, and
      perhaps had killed a trapper found there. Editors immediately reared a
      tall war out of it; but from five Indians in a guard-house waiting
      punishment not even an editor can supply spar for more than two editions,
      and if the recent alarm was still a matter of talk anywhere, it was not
      here in the sick-room. Whichever way the case should turn, it was through
      Molly alone (the doctor told her) that the wounded man had got this chance&mdash;this
      good chance, he related.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he told her she had not done a woman's part, but a man's part, and now
      had no more to do; no more till the patient got well, and could thank her
      in his own way, said the doctor, smiling, and supposing things that were
      not so&mdash;misled perhaps by Mrs. Taylor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I'll be gone by the time he is well,&rdquo; said Molly, coldly; and
      the discreet physician said ah, and that she would find Bennington quite a
      change from Bear Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Taylor spoke otherwise, and at that the girl said: &ldquo;I shall stay
      as long as I am needed. I will nurse him. I want to nurse him. I will do
      everything for him that I can!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that won't be anything, deary,&rdquo; said Mrs. Taylor, harshly. &ldquo;A year of
      nursing don't equal a day of sweetheart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl took a walk,&mdash;she was of no more service in the room at
      present,&mdash;but she turned without going far, and Mrs. Taylor spied her
      come to lean over the pasture fence and watch the two horses&mdash;that
      one the Virginian had &ldquo;gentled&rdquo; for her, and his own Monte. During this
      suspense came a new call for the doctor, neighbors profiting by his visit
      to Bear Creek; and in his going away to them, even under promise of quick
      return, Mrs. Taylor suspected a favorable sign. He kept his word as
      punctually as had been possible, arriving after some six hours with a
      confident face, and spending now upon the patient a care not needed, save
      to reassure the bystanders. He spoke his opinion that all was even better
      than he could have hoped it would be, so soon. Here was now the beginning
      of the fifth day; the wound's look was wholesome, no further delirium had
      come, and the fever had abated a degree while he was absent. He believed
      the serious danger-line lay behind, and (short of the unforeseen) the
      man's deep untainted strength would reassert its control. He had much
      blood to make, and must be cared for during weeks&mdash;three, four, five&mdash;there
      was no saying how long yet. These next few days it must be utter quiet for
      him; he must not talk nor hear anything likely to disturb him; and then
      the time for cheerfulness and gradual company would come&mdash;sooner than
      later, the doctor hoped. So he departed, and sent next day some bottles,
      with further cautions regarding the wound and dirt, and to say he should
      be calling the day after to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon that occasion he found two patients. Molly Wood lay in bed at Mrs.
      Taylor's, filled with apology and indignation. With little to do, and
      deprived of the strong stimulant of anxiety and action, her strength had
      quite suddenly left her, so that she had spoken only in a sort of whisper.
      But upon waking from a long sleep, after Mrs. Taylor had taken her firmly,
      almost severely, in hand, her natural voice had returned, and now the
      chief treatment the doctor gave her was a sort of scolding, which it
      pleased Mrs. Taylor to hear. The doctor even dropped a phrase concerning
      the arrogance of strong nerves in slender bodies, and of undertaking
      several people's work when several people were at hand to do it for
      themselves, and this pleased Mrs. Taylor remarkably. As for the wounded
      man, he was behaving himself properly. Perhaps in another week he could be
      moved to a more cheerful room. Just now, with cleanliness and pure air,
      any barn would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are real lucky to have such a sensible doctor in the country,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Taylor observed, after the physician had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;He said my room was a barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what you've made it, deary. But sick men don't notice much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, one may believe, without going widely astray, that illness,
      so far from veiling, more often quickens the perceptions&mdash;at any rate
      those of the naturally keen. On a later day&mdash;and the interval was
      brief&mdash;while Molly was on her second drive to take the air with Mrs.
      Taylor, that lady informed her that the sick man had noticed. &ldquo;And I could
      not tell him things liable to disturb him,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and so I&mdash;well,
      I expect I just didn't exactly tell him the facts. I said yes, you were
      packing up for a little visit to your folks. They had not seen you for
      quite a while, I said. And he looked at those boxes kind of silent like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no need to move him,&rdquo; said Molly. '&ldquo;It is simpler to move them&mdash;the
      boxes. I could take out some of my things, you know, just while he has to
      be kept there. I mean&mdash;you see, if the doctor says the room should be
      cheerful&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, deary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ask the doctor next time,&rdquo; said Molly, &ldquo;if he believes I am&mdash;competent
      to spread a rug upon a floor.&rdquo; Molly's references to the doctor were
      usually acid these days. And this he totally failed to observe, telling
      her when he came, why, to be sure! the very thing! And if she could play
      cards or read aloud, or afford any other light distractions, provided they
      did not lead the patient to talk and tire himself, that she would be most
      useful. Accordingly she took over the cribbage board, and came with
      unexpected hesitation face to face again with the swarthy man she had
      saved and tended. He was not so swarthy now, but neat, with chin clean,
      and hair and mustache trimmed and smooth, and he sat propped among pillows
      watching for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are better,&rdquo; she said, speaking first, and with uncertain voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. They have given me awdehs not to talk,&rdquo; said the Southerner,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Please do not talk&mdash;not to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Only this&rdquo;&mdash;he looked at her, and saw her seem to shrink&mdash;&ldquo;thank
      you for what you have done,&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took tenderly the hand he stretched to her; and upon these terms they
      set to work at cribbage. She won, and won again, and the third time laid
      down her cards and reproached him with playing in order to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, and his eye wandered to the boxes. &ldquo;But my thoughts get
      away from me. I'll be strong enough to hold them on the cyards next time,
      I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many tones in his voice she had heard, but never the tone of sadness until
      to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they played a little more, and she put away the board for this first
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going now?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I have made this room look a little less forlorn. They haven't
      wanted to meddle with my things, I suppose.&rdquo; And Molly stooped once again
      among the chattels destined for Vermont. Out they came; again the bearskin
      was spread on the floor, various possessions and ornaments went back into
      their ancient niches, the shelves grew comfortable with books, and, last,
      some flowers were stood on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More like old times,&rdquo; said the Virginian, but sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad,&rdquo; said Molly, &ldquo;you had to be brought into such a looking
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your folks waiting for you,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll pay my visit later,&rdquo; said Molly, putting the rug a trifle
      straighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask one thing?&rdquo; pleaded the Virginian, and at the gentleness of his
      voice her face grew rosy, and she fixed her eyes on him with a sort of
      dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything that I can answer,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Did I tell yu' to quit me, and did yu' load up my gun and stay?
      Was that a real business? I have been mixed up in my haid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was real,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;What else was there to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just nothing&mdash;for such as you!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;My haid has been
      mighty crazy; and that little grandmother of yours yondeh, she&mdash;but I
      can't just quite catch a-hold of these things&rdquo;&mdash;he passed a hand over
      his forehead&mdash;&ldquo;so many&mdash;or else one right along&mdash;well, it's
      all foolishness!&rdquo; he concluded, with something almost savage in his tone.
      And after she had gone from the cabin he lay very still, looking at the
      miniature on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in another sort of mood the next time, cribbage not interesting him
      in the least. &ldquo;Your folks will be wondering about you,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think they will mind which month I go to them,&rdquo; said Molly.
      &ldquo;Especially when they know the reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let me keep you, ma'am,&rdquo; said he. Molly stared at him; but he
      pursued, with the same edge lurking in his slow words: &ldquo;Though I'll never
      forget. How could I forget any of all you have done&mdash;and been? If
      there had been none of this, why, I had enough to remember! But please
      don't stay, ma'am. We'll say I had a claim when yu' found me pretty well
      dead, but I'm gettin' well, yu' see&mdash;right smart, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't understand, indeed I can't,&rdquo; said Molly, &ldquo;why you're talking so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to have certain moods when he would address her as &ldquo;ma'am,&rdquo; and
      this she did not like, but could not prevent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a sick man is funny. And yu' know I'm grateful to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please say no more about that, or I shall go this afternoon. I don't want
      to go. I am not ready. I think I had better read something now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. That's cert'nly a good notion. Why, this is the best show
      you'll ever get to give me education. Won't yu' please try that EMMA book
      now, ma'am? Listening to you will be different.&rdquo; This was said with
      softness and humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncertain&mdash;as his gravity often left her&mdash;precisely what he
      meant by what he said, Molly proceeded with EMMA, slackly at first, but
      soon with the enthusiasm that Miss Austen invariably gave her. She held
      the volume and read away at it, commenting briefly, and then, finishing a
      chapter of the sprightly classic, found her pupil slumbering peacefully.
      There was no uncertainty about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn't be doing a healthier thing for him, deary,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Taylor. &ldquo;If it gets to make him wakeful, try something harder.&rdquo; This was
      the lady's scarcely sympathetic view.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it turned out to be not obscurity in which Miss Austen sinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Molly next appeared at the Virginian's threshold, he said
      plaintively, &ldquo;I reckon I am a dunce.&rdquo; And he sued for pardon. &ldquo;When I
      waked up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was ashamed of myself for a plumb half-hour.&rdquo; Nor
      could she doubt this day that he meant what he said. His mood was again
      serene and gentle, and without referring to his singular words that had
      distressed her, he made her feel his contrition, even in his silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am right glad you have come,&rdquo; he said. And as he saw her going to the
      bookshelf, he continued, with diffidence: &ldquo;As regyards that EMMA book, yu'
      see&mdash;yu' see, the doin's and sayin's of folks like them are above me.
      But I think&rdquo; (he spoke most diffidently), &ldquo;if yu' could read me something
      that was ABOUT something, I&mdash;I'd be liable to keep awake.&rdquo; And he
      smiled with a certain shyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something ABOUT something?&rdquo; queried Molly, at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. Shakespeare. HENRY THE FOURTH. The British king is fighting,
      and there is his son the prince. He cert'nly must have been a jim-dandy
      boy if that is all true. Only he would go around town with a mighty
      triflin' gang. They sported and they held up citizens. And his father
      hated his travelling with trash like them. It was right natural&mdash;the
      boy and the old man! But the boy showed himself a man too. He killed a big
      fighter on the other side who was another jim-dandy&mdash;and he was sorry
      for having it to do.&rdquo; The Virginian warmed to his recital. &ldquo;I understand
      most all of that. There was a fat man kept everybody laughing. He was
      awful natural too; except yu' don't commonly meet 'em so fat. But the
      prince&mdash;that play is bed-rock, ma'am! Have you got something like
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I believe I see what you would
      appreciate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took her Browning, her idol, her imagined affinity. For the pale
      decadence of New England had somewhat watered her good old Revolutionary
      blood too, and she was inclined to think under glass and to live underdone&mdash;when
      there were no Indians to shoot! She would have joyed to venture
      &ldquo;Paracelsus&rdquo; on him, and some lengthy rhymed discourses; and she fondly
      turned leaves and leaves of her pet doggerel analytics. &ldquo;Pippa Passes&rdquo; and
      others she had to skip, from discreet motives&mdash;pages which he would
      have doubtless stayed awake at; but she chose a poem at length. This was
      better than Emma, he pronounced. And short. The horse was a good horse. He
      thought a man whose horse must not play out on him would watch the ground
      he was galloping over for holes, and not be likely to see what color the
      rims of his animal's eye-sockets were. You could not see them if you sat
      as you ought to for such a hard ride. Of the next piece that she read him
      he thought still better. &ldquo;And it is short,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But the last part
      drops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly instantly exacted particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The soldier should not have told the general he was killed,&rdquo; stated the
      cow-puncher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should he have told him, I'd like to know?&rdquo; said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, just nothing. If the soldier could ride out of the battle all shot
      up, and tell his general about their takin' the town&mdash;that was being
      gritty, yu' see. But that truck at the finish&mdash;will yu' please say it
      again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Molly read:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;'You're wounded! 'Nay,' the soldier's pride
     Touched to the quick, he said,
     'I'm killed, sire!' And, his chief beside,
     Smiling the boy fell dead.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Nay, I'm killed, sire,'&rdquo; drawled the Virginian, amiably; for (symptom of
      convalescence) his freakish irony was revived in him. &ldquo;Now a man who was
      man enough to act like he did, yu' see, would fall dead without mentioning
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      None of Molly's sweet girl friends had ever thus challenged Mr. Browning.
      They had been wont to cluster over him with a joyous awe that deepened
      proportionally with their misunderstanding. Molly paused to consider this
      novelty of view about the soldier. &ldquo;He was a Frenchman, you know,&rdquo; she
      said, under inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Frenchman,&rdquo; murmured the grave cow-puncher. &ldquo;I never knowed a Frenchman,
      but I reckon they might perform that class of foolishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why was it foolish?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His soldier's pride&mdash;don't you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly now burst into a luxury of discussion. She leaned toward her
      cow-puncher with bright eyes searching his; with elbow on knee and hand
      propping chin, her lap became a slant, and from it Browning the poet slid
      and toppled, and lay unrescued. For the slow cow-puncher unfolded his
      notions of masculine courage and modesty (though he did not deal in such
      high-sounding names), and Molly forgot everything to listen to him, as he
      forgot himself and his inveterate shyness and grew talkative to her. &ldquo;I
      would never have supposed that!&rdquo; she would exclaim as she heard him; or,
      presently again, &ldquo;I never had such an idea!&rdquo; And her mind opened with
      delight to these new things which came from the man's mind so simple and
      direct. To Browning they did come back, but the Virginian, though
      interested, conceived a dislike for him. &ldquo;He is a smarty,&rdquo; said he, once
      or twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now here is something,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;I have never known what to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Heavens!&rdquo; murmured the sick man, smiling. &ldquo;Is it short?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very short. Now please attend.&rdquo; And she read him twelve lines about a
      lover who rowed to a beach in the dusk, crossed a field, tapped at a pane,
      and was admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the best yet,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;There's only one thing yu'
      can think about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wait,&rdquo; said the girl, swiftly. &ldquo;Here is how they parted:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Round the cape of a sudden came the sea,
     And the sun looked over the mountain's rim&mdash;
     And straight was a path of gold for him,
     And the need of a world of men for me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very, very true,&rdquo; murmured the Virginian, dropping his eyes from
      the girl's intent ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had they quarrelled?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon he loved her very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you're sure they hadn't quarrelled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead sure, ma'am. He would come back afteh he had played some more of the
      game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life, ma'am. Whatever he was a-doin' in the world of men. That's a
      bed-rock piece, ma'am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't see why you think it's so much better than some of the
      others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could sca'cely explain,&rdquo; answered the man. &ldquo;But that writer does know
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad they hadn't quarrelled,&rdquo; said Molly, thoughtfully. And she
      began to like having her opinions refuted.
    </p>
    <p>
      His bandages, becoming a little irksome, had to be shifted, and this
      turned their discourse from literature to Wyoming; and Molly inquired, had
      he ever been shot before? Only once, he told her. &ldquo;I have been lucky in
      having few fusses,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I hate them. If a man has to be killed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never&mdash;&rdquo; broke in Molly. She had started back a little. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
       she added hastily, &ldquo;don't tell me if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't wonder if I got one of those Indians,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;But
      I wasn't waitin' to see! But I came mighty near doing for a white man that
      day. He had been hurtin' a hawss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurting?&rdquo; said Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Injurin.' I will not tell yu' about that. It would hurt yu' to hear such
      things. But hawsses&mdash;don't they depend on us? Ain't they somethin'
      like children? I did not lay up the man very bad. He was able to travel
      'most right away. Why, you'd have wanted to kill him yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the Virginian talked, nor knew what he was doing to the girl. Nor was
      she aware of what she was receiving from him as he unwittingly spoke
      himself out to her in these Browning meetings they had each day. But Mrs.
      Taylor grew pleased. The kindly dame would sometimes cross the road to see
      if she were needed, and steal away again after a peep at the window.
      There, inside, among the restored home treasures, sat the two: the rosy
      alert girl, sweet as she talked or read to him; and he, the grave,
      half-weak giant among his wraps, watching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of her delayed home visit he never again spoke, either to her or to Mrs.
      Taylor; and Molly veered aside from any trend of talk she foresaw was
      leading toward that subject. But in those hours when no visitors came, and
      he was by himself in the quiet, he would lie often sombrely contemplating
      the girl's room, her little dainty knickknacks, her home photographs, all
      the delicate manifestations of what she came from and what she was.
      Strength was flowing back into him each day, and Judge Henry's latest
      messenger had brought him clothes and mail from Sunk Creek and many
      inquiries of kindness, and returned taking the news of the cow-puncher's
      improvement, and how soon he would be permitted the fresh air. Hence Molly
      found him waiting in a flannel shirt of highly becoming shade, and with a
      silk handkerchief knotted round his throat; and he told her it was good to
      feel respectable again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come to read to him for the allotted time; and she threw around
      his shoulders the scarlet and black Navajo blanket, striped with its
      splendid zigzags of barbarity. Thus he half sat, half leaned, languid but
      at ease. In his lap lay one of the letters brought over by the messenger:
      and though she was midway in a book that engaged his full attention&mdash;DAVID
      COPPERFIELD&mdash;his silence and absent look this morning stopped her,
      and she accused him of not attending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he admitted; &ldquo;I am thinking of something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with that apprehension which he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had to come,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And to-day I see my thoughts straighter than
      I've been up to managing since&mdash;since my haid got clear. And now I
      must say these thoughts&mdash;if I can, if I can!&rdquo; He stopped. His eyes
      were intent upon her; one hand was gripping the arm of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised&mdash;&rdquo; trembled Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised you should love me,&rdquo; he sternly interrupted. &ldquo;Promised that to
      myself. I have broken that word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shut DAVID COPPERFIELD mechanically, and grew white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your letter has come to me hyeh,&rdquo; he continued, gentle again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My&mdash;&rdquo; She had forgotten it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter you wrote to tell me good-by. You wrote it a little while ago&mdash;not
      a month yet, but it's away and away long gone for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never let you know&mdash;&rdquo; began Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor,&rdquo; he interrupted once more, but very gently now, &ldquo;he gave
      awdehs I must be kept quiet. I reckon yu' thought tellin' me might&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;Indeed I ought to have told you sooner!
      Indeed I had no excuse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, should yu' tell me if yu' preferred not? You had written. And you
      speak&rdquo; (he lifted the letter) &ldquo;of never being able to repay kindness; but
      you have turned the tables. I can never repay you by anything! by
      anything! So I had figured I would just jog back to Sunk Creek and let you
      get away, if you did not want to say that kind of good-by. For I saw the
      boxes. Mrs. Taylor is too nice a woman to know the trick of lyin', and she
      could not deceive me. I have knowed yu' were going away for good ever
      since I saw those boxes. But now hyeh comes your letter, and it seems no
      way but I must speak. I have thought a deal, lyin' in this room. And&mdash;to-day&mdash;I
      can say what I have thought. I could not make you happy.&rdquo; He stopped, but
      she did not answer. His voice had grown softer than whispering, but yet
      was not a whisper. From its quiet syllables she turned away, blinded with
      sudden tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once, I thought love must surely be enough,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;And I thought
      if I could make you love me, you could learn me to be less&mdash;less&mdash;more
      your kind. And I think I could give you a pretty good sort of love. But
      that don't help the little mean pesky things of day by day that make
      roughness or smoothness for folks tied together so awful close. Mrs.
      Taylor hyeh&mdash;she don't know anything better than Taylor does. She
      don't want anything he can't give her. Her friends will do for him and his
      for her. And when I dreamed of you in my home&mdash;&rdquo; he closed his eyes
      and drew a long breath. At last he looked at her again. &ldquo;This is no
      country for a lady. Will yu' forget and forgive the bothering I have
      done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Molly. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; And she put her hands to her eyes. She had risen
      and stood with her face covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I surely had to tell you this all out, didn't I?&rdquo; said the cow-puncher,
      faintly, in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Molly again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have put it clear how it is,&rdquo; he pursued. &ldquo;I ought to have seen from
      the start I was not the sort to keep you happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Molly&mdash;&ldquo;but I&mdash;you ought&mdash;please try to keep me
      happy!&rdquo; And sinking by his chair, she hid her face on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speechless, he bent down and folded her round, putting his hands on the
      hair that had been always his delight. Presently he whispered:&mdash; &ldquo;You
      have beat me; how can I fight this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered nothing. The Navajo's scarlet and black folds fell over both.
      Not with words, not even with meeting eyes, did the two plight their troth
      in this first new hour. So they remained long, the fair head nesting in
      the great arms, and the black head laid against it, while over the silent
      room presided the little Grandmother Stark in her frame, rosy, blue, and
      flaxen, not quite familiar, not quite smiling.

    <h2>
      XXVIII. NO DREAM TO WAKE FROM
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a long while after she had left him, he lay still, stretched in his
      chair. His eyes were fixed steadily upon the open window and the sunshine
      outside. There he watched the movement of the leaves upon the green
      cottonwoods. What had she said to him when she went? She had said, &ldquo;Now I
      know how unhappy I have been.&rdquo; These sweet words he repeated to himself
      over and over, fearing in some way that he might lose them. They almost
      slipped from him at times; but with a jump of his mind he caught them
      again and held them,&mdash;and then&mdash;&ldquo;I'm not all strong yet,&rdquo; he
      murmured. &ldquo;I must have been very sick.&rdquo; And, weak from his bullet wound
      and fever, he closed his eyes without knowing it. There were the
      cottonwoods again, waving, waving; and he felt the cool, pleasant air from
      the window. He saw the light draught stir the ashes in the great stone
      fireplace. &ldquo;I have been asleep,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But she was cert'nly here
      herself. Oh, yes. Surely. She always has to go away every day because the
      doctor says&mdash;why, she was readin'!&rdquo; he broke off, aloud. &ldquo;DAVID
      COPPERFIELD.&rdquo; There it was on the floor. &ldquo;Aha! nailed you anyway!&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;But how scared I am of myself!&mdash;You're a fool. Of course it's
      so. No fever business could make yu' feel like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eye dwelt awhile on the fireplace, next on the deer horns, and next it
      travelled toward the shelf where her books were; but it stopped before
      reaching them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better say off the names before I look,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I've had a heap o'
      misreading visions. And&mdash;and supposin'&mdash;if this was just my
      sickness fooling me some more&mdash;I'd want to die. I would die! Now
      we'll see. If COPPERFIELD is on the floor&rdquo; (he looked stealthily to be
      sure that it was), &ldquo;then she was readin' to me when everything happened,
      and then there should be a hole in the book row, top, left. Top, left,&rdquo; he
      repeated, and warily brought his glance to the place. &ldquo;Proved!&rdquo; he cried.
      &ldquo;It's all so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He now noticed the miniature of Grandmother Stark. &ldquo;You are awful like
      her,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You're cert'nly awful like her. May I kiss you too,
      ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, tottering, he rose from his sick-chair. The Navajo blanket fell from
      his shoulders, and gradually, experimentally, he stood upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helping himself with his hand slowly along the wall of the room, and round
      to the opposite wall with many a pause, he reached the picture, and very
      gently touched the forehead of the ancestral dame with his lips. &ldquo;I
      promise to make your little girl happy,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He almost fell in stooping to the portrait, but caught himself and stood
      carefully quiet, trembling, and speaking to himself. &ldquo;Where is your
      strength?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I reckon it is joy that has unsteadied your
      laigs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened. It was she, come back with his dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Heavens!&rdquo; she said; and setting the tray down, she rushed to him. She
      helped him back to his chair, and covered him again. He had suffered no
      hurt, but she clung to him; and presently he moved and let himself kiss
      her with fuller passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be good,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You looked so pale!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are speakin' low like me,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But we have no dream we can
      wake from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had she surrendered on this day to her cow-puncher, her wild man? Was she
      forever wholly his? Had the Virginian's fire so melted her heart that no
      rift in it remained? So she would have thought if any thought had come to
      her. But in his arms to-day, thought was lost in something more divine.

    <h2>
      XXIX. WORD TO BENNINGTON
    </h2>
    <p>
      They kept their secret for a while, or at least they had that special joy
      of believing that no one in all the world but themselves knew this that
      had happened to them. But I think that there was one person who knew how
      to keep a secret even better than these two lovers. Mrs. Taylor made no
      remarks to any one whatever. Nobody on Bear Creek, however, was so
      extraordinarily cheerful and serene. That peculiar severity which she had
      manifested in the days when Molly was packing her possessions, had now
      altogether changed. In these days she was endlessly kind and indulgent to
      her &ldquo;deary.&rdquo; Although, as a housekeeper, Mrs. Taylor believed in
      punctuality at meals, and visited her offspring with discipline when they
      were late without good and sufficient excuse, Molly was now exempt from
      the faintest hint of reprimand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it's not because you're not her mother,&rdquo; said George Taylor,
      bitterly. &ldquo;She used to get it, too. And we're the only ones that get it.
      There she comes, just as we're about ready to quit! Aren't you going to
      say NOTHING to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;when you've saved a man's life it'll be time
      for you to talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Molly would come in to her meals with much irregularity; and her
      remarks about the imperfections of her clock met with no rejoinder. And
      yet one can scarcely be so severe as had been Mrs. Taylor, and become
      wholly as mild as milk. There was one recurrent event that could
      invariably awaken hostile symptoms in the dame. Whenever she saw a letter
      arrive with the Bennington postmark upon it, she shook her fist at that
      letter. &ldquo;What's family pride?&rdquo; she would say to herself. &ldquo;Taylor could be
      a Son of the Revolution if he'd a mind to. I wonder if she has told her
      folks yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when letters directed to Bennington would go out, Mrs. Taylor would
      inspect every one as if its envelope ought to grow transparent beneath her
      eyes, and yield up to her its great secret, if it had one. But in truth
      these letters had no great secret to yield up, until one day&mdash;yes;
      one day Mrs. Taylor would have burst, were bursting a thing that people
      often did. Three letters were the cause of this emotion on Mrs. Taylor's
      part; one addressed to Bennington, one to Dunbarton, and the third&mdash;here
      was the great excitement&mdash;to Bennington, but not in the little
      schoolmarm's delicate writing. A man's hand had traced those plain, steady
      vowels and consonants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's come!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Taylor, at this sight. &ldquo;He has written to her
      mother himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That is what the Virginian had done, and here is how it had come about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sick man's convalescence was achieved. The weeks had brought back to
      him, not his whole strength yet&mdash;that could come only by many miles
      of open air on the back of Monte; but he was strong enough now to GET
      strength. When a patient reaches this stage, he is out of the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had gone for a little walk with his nurse. They had taken (under the
      doctor's recommendation) several such little walks, beginning with a
      five-minute one, and at last to-day accomplishing three miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it has not been too far,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am afraid I could walk twice as
      far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Because it means I can go to work again. This thing we have had
      together is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For reply, she leaned against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at you!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only a little while ago you had to help me stand
      on my laigs. And now&mdash;&rdquo; For a while there was silence between them.
      &ldquo;I have never had a right down sickness before,&rdquo; he presently went on.
      &ldquo;Not to remember, that is. If any person had told me I could ENJOY such a
      thing&mdash;&rdquo; He said no more, for she reached up, and no more speech was
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has it been?&rdquo; he next asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it could be forever&mdash;no. Not forever with no more than
      this. I reckon I'd be sick again! But if it could be forever with just you
      and me, and no one else to bother with. But any longer would not be doing
      right by your mother. She would have a right to think ill of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Let us keep it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not after I am gone. Your mother must be told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems so&mdash;can't we&mdash;oh, why need anybody know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother ain't 'anybody.' She is your mother. I feel mighty
      responsible to her for what I have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so? Your mother will not think so. I am going to write to
      her to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! Write to my mother! Oh, then everything will be so different! They
      will all&mdash;&rdquo; Molly stopped before the rising visions of Bennington.
      Upon the fairy-tale that she had been living with her cow-boy lover broke
      the voices of the world. She could hear them from afar. She could see the
      eyes of Bennington watching this man at her side. She could imagine the
      ears of Bennington listening for slips in his English. There loomed upon
      her the round of visits which they would have to make. The ringing of the
      door-bells, the waiting in drawing-rooms for the mistress to descend and
      utter her prepared congratulations, while her secret eye devoured the
      Virginian's appearance, and his manner of standing and sitting. He would
      be wearing gloves, instead of fringed gauntlets of buckskin. In a smooth
      black coat and waistcoat, how could they perceive the man he was? During
      those short formal interviews, what would they ever find out of the things
      that she knew about him? The things for which she was proud of him? He
      would speak shortly and simply; they would say, &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; and &ldquo;How
      different you must find this from Wyoming!&rdquo;&mdash;and then, after the door
      was shut behind his departing back they would say&mdash;He would be
      totally underrated, not in the least understood. Why should he be
      subjected to this? He should never be!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in all these half-formed, hurried, distressing thoughts which streamed
      through the girl's mind, she altogether forgot one truth. True it was that
      the voice of the world would speak as she imagined. True it was that in
      the eyes of her family and acquaintance this lover of her choice would be
      examined even more like a SPECIMEN than are other lovers upon these
      occasions: and all accepted lovers have to face this ordeal of being
      treated like specimens by the other family. But dear me! most of us manage
      to stand it, don't we? It isn't, perhaps, the most delicious experience
      that we can recall in connection with our engagement. But it didn't prove
      fatal. We got through it somehow. We dined with Aunt Jane, and wined with
      Uncle Joseph, and perhaps had two fingers given to us by old Cousin
      Horatio, whose enormous fortune was of the greatest importance to
      everybody. And perhaps fragments of the other family's estimate of us
      subsequently reached our own ears. But if a chosen lover cannot stand
      being treated as a specimen by the other family, he's a very weak vessel,
      and not worth any good girl's love. That's all I can say for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Virginian was scarcely what even his enemy would term a weak
      vessel; and Molly's jealousy of the impression which he might make upon
      Bennington was vastly superfluous. She should have known that he would
      indeed care to make a good impression; but that such anxiety on his part
      would be wholly for her sake, that in the eyes of her friends she might
      stand justified in taking him for her wedded husband. So far as he was
      concerned apart from her, Aunt Jane and Uncle Joseph might say anything
      they pleased, or think anything they pleased. His character was open for
      investigation. Judge Henry would vouch for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what he would have said to his sweetheart had she but revealed to
      him her perturbations. But she did not reveal them; and they were not of
      the order that he with his nature was likely to divine. I do not know what
      good would have come from her speaking out to him, unless that perfect
      understanding between lovers which indeed is a good thing. But I do not
      believe that he could have reassured her; and I am certain that she could
      not have prevented his writing to her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; she sighed at last, &ldquo;if you think so, I will tell her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That sigh of hers, be it well understood, was not only because of those
      far-off voices which the world would in consequence of her news be lifting
      presently. It came also from bidding farewell to the fairy-tale which she
      must leave now; that land in which she and he had been living close
      together alone, unhindered, unmindful of all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will tell her,&rdquo; said her lover. &ldquo;And I must tell her too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of us?&rdquo; questioned the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would he say to her mother? How would her mother like such a letter
      as he would write to her? Suppose he should misspell a word? Would not
      sentences from him at this time&mdash;written sentences&mdash;be a further
      bar to his welcome acceptance at Bennington?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you send messages by me?&rdquo; she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;She is not going to like it, anyway,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I
      must speak to her direct. It would be like shirking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly saw how true his instinct was here; and a little flame shot upward
      from the glow of her love and pride in him. Oh, if they could all only
      know that he was like this when you understood him! She did not dare say
      out to him what her fear was about this letter of his to her mother. She
      did not dare because&mdash;well, because she lacked a little faith. That
      is it, I am afraid. And for that sin she was her own punishment. For in
      this day, and in many days to come, the pure joy of her love was vexed and
      clouded, all through a little lack of faith; while for him, perfect in his
      faith, his joy was like crystal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what you're going to write,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you going to let me see it when it's done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then a freakish look came into his eyes. &ldquo;I'll let yu' see anything
      I write to other women.&rdquo; And he gave her one of his long kisses. &ldquo;Let's
      get through with it together,&rdquo; he suggested, when they were once more in
      his sick-room, that room which she had given to him. &ldquo;You'll sit one side
      o' the table, and I'll sit the other, and we'll go ahaid; and pretty soon
      it will be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yes, I suppose that is the best way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so, accordingly, they took their places. The inkstand stood between
      them. Beside each of them she distributed paper enough, almost, for a
      presidential message. And pens and pencils were in plenty. Was this not
      the headquarters of the Bear Creek schoolmarm?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, aren't you going to do it in pencil first?&rdquo; she exclaimed, looking
      up from her vacant sheet. His pen was moving slowly, but steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't reckon I need to,&rdquo; he answered, with his nose close to the
      paper. &ldquo;Oh, damnation, there's a blot!&rdquo; He tore his spoiled beginning in
      small bits, and threw them into the fireplace. &ldquo;You've got it too full,&rdquo;
       he commented; and taking the inkstand, he tipped a little from it out of
      the window. She sat lost among her false starts. Had she heard him swear,
      she would not have minded. She rather liked it when he swore. He possessed
      that quality in his profanity of not offending by it. It is quite
      wonderful how much worse the same word will sound in one man's lips than
      in another's. But she did not hear him. Her mind was among a litter of
      broken sentences. Each thought which she began ran out into the empty air,
      or came against some stone wall. So there she sat, her eyes now upon that
      inexorable blank sheet that lay before her, waiting, and now turned with
      vacant hopelessness upon the sundry objects in the room. And while she
      thus sat accomplishing nothing, opposite to her the black head bent down,
      and the steady pen moved from phrase to phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became aware of his gazing at her, flushed and solemn. That strange
      color of the sea-water, which she could never name, was lustrous in his
      eyes. He was folding his letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have finished?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; His voice was very quiet. &ldquo;I feel like an honester man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I can do something to-night at Mrs. Taylor's,&rdquo; she said, looking
      at her paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      On it were a few words crossed out. This was all she had to show. At this
      set task in letter-writing, the cow-puncher had greatly excelled the
      schoolmarm!
    </p>
    <p>
      But that night, while he lay quite fast asleep in his bed, she was keeping
      vigil in her room at Mrs. Taylor's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the next day, those three letters departed for the mail, and
      Mrs. Taylor consequently made her exclamation, &ldquo;It's come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the day before the Virginian returned to take up his work at Judge
      Henry's ranch, he and Molly announced their news. What Molly said to Mrs.
      Taylor and what Mrs. Taylor said to her, is of no interest to us, though
      it was of much to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. McLean happened to make a call quite early in the morning to
      inquire for his friend's health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lin,&rdquo; began the Virginian, &ldquo;there is no harm in your knowing an hour or
      so before the rest, I am&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; said Mr. McLean, indulgently. &ldquo;Everybody has knowed that since the
      day she found yu' at the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not so, then,&rdquo; said the Virginian, crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord! Everybody has knowed it right along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hmp!&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;I didn't know this country was that rank with
      gossips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McLean laughed mirthfully at the lover. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mrs. McLean
      will be glad. She told me to give yu' her congratulations quite a while
      ago. I was to have 'em ready just as soon as ever yu' asked for 'em
      yourself.&rdquo; Lin had been made a happy man some twelve months previous to
      this. And now, by way of an exchange of news, he added: &ldquo;We're expectin' a
      little McLean down on Box Elder. That's what you'll be expectin' some of
      these days, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured the Virginian, &ldquo;I hope so too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I don't guess,&rdquo; said Lin, &ldquo;that you and I will do much shufflin' of
      other folks' children any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon he and the Virginian shook hands silently, and understood each
      other very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day that the Virginian parted with Molly, beside the weight of
      farewell which lay heavy on his heart, his thoughts were also grave with
      news. The cattle thieves had grown more audacious. Horses and cattle both
      were being missed, and each man began almost to doubt his neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steps will have to be taken soon by somebody, I reckon,&rdquo; said the lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By you?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most likely I'll get mixed up with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you have to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't say. I'll tell yu' when I come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So did he part from her, leaving her more kisses than words to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what was doing at Bennington, meanwhile, and at Dunbarton? Those three
      letters which by their mere outside had so moved Mrs. Taylor, produced by
      their contents much painful disturbance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be remembered that Molly wrote to her mother, and to her
      great-aunt. That announcement to her mother was undertaken first. Its
      composition occupied three hours and a half, and it filled eleven pages,
      not counting a postscript upon the twelfth. The letter to the great-aunt
      took only ten minutes. I cannot pretend to explain why this one was so
      greatly superior to the other; but such is the remarkable fact. Its
      beginning, to be sure, did give the old lady a start; she had dismissed
      the cow-boy from her probabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut!&rdquo; she exclaimed out loud in her bedroom. &ldquo;She has thrown
      herself away on that fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But some sentences at the end made her pause and sit still for a long
      while. The severity upon her face changed to tenderness, gradually. &ldquo;Ah,
      me,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;If marriage were as simple as love!&rdquo; Then she went
      slowly downstairs, and out into her garden, where she walked long between
      the box borders. &ldquo;But if she has found a great love,&rdquo; said the old lady at
      length. And she returned to her bedroom, and opened an old desk, and read
      some old letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came to her the next morning a communication from Bennington. This
      had been penned frantically by poor Mrs. Wood. As soon as she had been
      able to gather her senses after the shock of her daughter's eleven pages
      and the postscript, the mother had poured out eight pages herself to the
      eldest member of the family. There had been, indeed, much excuse for the
      poor lady. To begin with, Molly had constructed her whole opening page
      with the express and merciful intention of preparing her mother.
      Consequently, it made no sense whatever. Its effect was the usual effect
      of remarks designed to break a thing gently. It merely made Mrs. Wood's
      head swim, and filled her with a sickening dread. &ldquo;Oh, mercy, Sarah,&rdquo; she
      had cried, &ldquo;come here. What does this mean?&rdquo; And then, fortified by her
      elder daughter, she had turned over that first page and found what it
      meant on the top of the second. &ldquo;A savage with knives and pistols!&rdquo; she
      wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother, I always told you so,&rdquo; said her daughter Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a foreman?&rdquo; exclaimed the mother. &ldquo;And who is Judge Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has taken a sort of upper servant,&rdquo; said Sarah. &ldquo;If it is allowed to
      go as far as a wedding, I doubt if I can bring myself to be present.&rdquo;
       (This threat she proceeded to make to Molly, with results that shall be
      set forth in their proper place.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man appears to have written to me himself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows no better,&rdquo; said Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; said Sarah's husband later. &ldquo;It was a very manly thing to do.&rdquo;
       Thus did consternation rage in the house at Bennington. Molly might have
      spared herself the many assurances that she gave concerning the universal
      esteem in which her cow-puncher was held, and the fair prospects which
      were his. So, in the first throes of her despair, Mrs. Wood wrote those
      eight not maturely considered pages to the great-aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut!&rdquo; said the great-aunt as she read them. Her face was much
      more severe to-day. &ldquo;You'd suppose,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that the girl had been
      kidnapped! Why, she has kept him waiting three years!&rdquo; And then she read
      more, but soon put the letter down with laughter. For Mrs. Wood had
      repeated in writing that early outburst of hers about a savage with knives
      and pistols. &ldquo;Law!&rdquo; said the great-aunt. &ldquo;Law, what a fool Lizzie is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she sat down and wrote to Mrs. Wood a wholesome reply about putting a
      little more trust in her own flesh and blood, and reminding her among
      other things that General Stark had himself been wont to carry knives and
      pistols owing to the necessities of his career, but that he had
      occasionally taken them off, as did probably this young man in Wyoming.
      &ldquo;You had better send me the letter he has written you,&rdquo; she concluded. &ldquo;I
      shall know much better what to think after I have seen that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is not probable that Mrs. Wood got much comfort from this
      communication; and her daughter Sarah was actually enraged by it. &ldquo;She
      grows more perverse as she nears her dotage,&rdquo; said Sarah. But the
      Virginian's letter was sent to Dunbarton, where the old lady sat herself
      down to read it with much attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is what the Virginian had said to the unknown mother of his
      sweetheart.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JOHN STARK WOOD Bennington, Vermont.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madam: If your daughter Miss Wood has ever told you about her saving a
      man's life here when some Indians had shot him that is the man who writes
      to you now. I don't think she can have told you right about that affair
      for she is the only one in this country who thinks it was a little thing.
      So I must tell you it, the main points. Such an action would have been
      thought highly of in a Western girl, but with Miss Wood's raising nobody
      had a right to expect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; snorted the great-aunt. &ldquo;Well, he would be right, if I had not
      had a good deal more to do with her 'raising' than ever Lizzie had.&rdquo; And
      she went on with the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was starting in to die when she found me. I did not know anything then,
      and she pulled me back from where I was half in the next world. She did
      not know but what Indians would get her too but I could not make her leave
      me. I am a heavy man one hundred and seventy-three stripped when in full
      health. She lifted me herself from the ground me helping scarce any for
      there was not much help in me that day. She washed my wound and brought me
      to with her own whiskey. Before she could get me home I was out of my head
      but she kept me on my horse somehow and talked wisely to me so I minded
      her and did not go clean crazy till she had got me safe to bed. The doctor
      says I would have died all the same if she had not nursed me the way she
      did. It made me love her more which I did not know I could. But there is
      no end, for this writing it down makes me love her more as I write it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Mrs. Wood I am sorry this will be bad news for you to hear. I know
      you would never choose such a man as I am for her for I have got no
      education and must write humble against my birth. I wish I could make the
      news easier but truth is the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am of old stock in Virginia. English and one Scotch Irish grandmother my
      father's father brought from Kentucky. We have always stayed at the same
      place farmers and hunters not bettering our lot and very plain. We have
      fought when we got the chance, under Old Hickory and in Mexico and my
      father and two brothers were killed in the Valley sixty-four. Always with
      us one son has been apt to run away and I was the one this time. I had too
      much older brothering to suit me. But now I am doing well being in full
      sight of prosperity and not too old and very strong my health having stood
      the sundries it has been put through. She shall teach school no more when
      she is mine. I wish I could make this news easier for you Mrs. Wood. I do
      not like promises I have heard so many. I will tell any man of your family
      anything he likes to ask one, and Judge Henry would tell you about my
      reputation. I have seen plenty rough things but can say I have never
      killed for pleasure or profit and am not one of that kind, always
      preferring peace. I have had to live in places where they had courts and
      lawyers so called but an honest man was all the law you could find in five
      hundred miles. I have not told her about those things not because I am
      ashamed of them but there are so many things too dark for a girl like her
      to hear about.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had better tell you the way I know I love Miss Wood. I am not a boy now,
      and women are no new thing to me. A man like me who has travelled meets
      many of them as he goes and passes on but I stopped when I came to Miss
      Wood. That is three years but I have not gone on. What right has such as
      he? you will say. So did I say it after she had saved my life. It was hard
      to get to that point and keep there with her around me all day. But I said
      to myself you have bothered her for three years with your love and if you
      let your love bother her you don't love her like you should and you must
      quit for her sake who has saved your life. I did not know what I was going
      to do with my life after that but I supposed I could go somewhere and work
      hard and so Mrs. Wood I told her I would give her up. But she said no. It
      is going to be hard for her to get used to a man like me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this point in the Virginian's letter, the old great-aunt could read
      no more. She rose, and went over to that desk where lay those faded
      letters of her own. She laid her head down upon the package, and as her
      tears flowed quietly upon it, &ldquo;O dear,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;O dear! And this
      is what I lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To her girl upon Bear Creek she wrote the next day. And this word from
      Dunbarton was like balm among the harsh stings Molly was receiving. The
      voices of the world reached her in gathering numbers, and not one of them
      save that great-aunt's was sweet. Her days were full of hurts; and there
      was no one by to kiss the hurts away. Nor did she even hear from her lover
      any more now. She only knew he had gone into lonely regions upon his
      errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      That errand took him far:&mdash; Across the Basin, among the secret places
      of Owl Creek, past the Washakie Needles, over the Divide to Gros Ventre,
      and so through a final barrier of peaks into the borders of East Idaho.
      There, by reason of his bidding me, I met him, and came to share in a part
      of his errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with no guide that I travelled to him. He had named a little
      station on the railroad, and from thence he had charted my route by means
      of landmarks. Did I believe in omens, the black storm that I set out in
      upon my horse would seem like one to-day. But I had been living in cities
      and smoke; and Idaho, even with rain, was delightful to me.

    <h2>
      XXX. A STABLE ON THE FLAT
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the first landmark, the lone clump of cottonwoods, came at length in
      sight, dark and blurred in the gentle rain, standing out perhaps a mile
      beyond the distant buildings, my whole weary body hailed the approach of
      repose. Saving the noon hour, I had been in the saddle since six, and now
      six was come round again. The ranch, my resting-place for this night, was
      a ruin&mdash;cabin, stable, and corral. Yet after the twelve hours of
      pushing on and on through silence, still to have silence, still to eat and
      go to sleep in it, perfectly fitted the mood of both my flesh and spirit.
      At noon, when for a while I had thrown off my long oilskin coat, merely
      the sight of the newspaper half crowded into my pocket had been a
      displeasing reminder of the railway, and cities, and affairs. But for its
      possible help to build fires, it would have come no farther with me. The
      great levels around me lay cooled and freed of dust by the wet weather,
      and full of sweet airs. Far in front the foot-hills rose through the rain,
      indefinite and mystic. I wanted no speech with any one, nor to be near
      human beings at all. I was steeped in a revery as of the primal earth;
      even thoughts themselves had almost ceased motion. To lie down with wild
      animals, with elk and deer, would have made my waking dream complete; and
      since such dream could not be, the cattle around the deserted buildings,
      mere dots as yet across separating space, were my proper companions for
      this evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow night I should probably be camping with the Virginian in the
      foot-hills. At his letter's bidding I had come eastward across Idaho,
      abandoning my hunting in the Saw Tooth Range to make this journey with him
      back through the Tetons. It was a trail known to him, and not to many
      other honest men. Horse Thief Pass was the name his letter gave it.
      Business (he was always brief) would call him over there at this time.
      Returning, he must attend to certain matters in the Wind River country.
      There I could leave by stage for the railroad, or go on with him the whole
      way back to Sunk Creek. He designated for our meeting the forks of a
      certain little stream in the foot-hills which to-day's ride had brought in
      sight. There would be no chance for him to receive an answer from me in
      the intervening time. If by a certain day&mdash;which was four days off
      still&mdash;I had not reached the forks, he would understand I had other
      plans. To me it was like living back in ages gone, this way of meeting my
      friend, this choice of a stream so far and lonely that its very course
      upon the maps was wrongly traced. And to leave behind all noise and
      mechanisms, and set out at ease, slowly, with one packhorse, into the
      wilderness, made me feel that the ancient earth was indeed my mother and
      that I had found her again after being lost among houses, customs, and
      restraints. I should arrive three days early at the forks&mdash;three days
      of margin seeming to me a wise precaution against delays unforeseen. If
      the Virginian were not there, good; I could fish and be happy. If he were
      there but not ready to start, good; I could still fish and be happy. And
      remembering my Eastern helplessness in the year when we had met first, I
      enjoyed thinking how I had come to be trusted. In those days I had not
      been allowed to go from the ranch for so much as an afternoon's ride
      unless tied to him by a string, so to speak; now I was crossing unmapped
      spaces with no guidance. The man who could do this was scarce any longer a
      &ldquo;tenderfoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My vision, as I rode, took in serenely the dim foot-hills,&mdash;to-morrow's
      goal,&mdash;and nearer in the vast wet plain the clump of cottonwoods, and
      still nearer my lodging for to-night with the dotted cattle round it. And
      now my horse neighed. I felt his gait freshen for the journey's end, and
      leaning to pat his neck I noticed his ears no longer slack and
      inattentive, but pointing forward to where food and rest awaited both of
      us. Twice he neighed, impatiently and long; and as he quickened his gait
      still more, the packhorse did the same, and I realized that there was
      about me still a spice of the tenderfoot: those dots were not cattle; they
      were horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      My horse had put me in the wrong. He had known his kind from afar, and was
      hastening to them. The plainsman's eye was not yet mine; and I smiled a
      little as I rode. When was I going to know, as by instinct, the different
      look of horses and cattle across some two or three miles of plain?
    </p>
    <p>
      These miles we finished soon. The buildings changed in their aspect as
      they grew to my approach, showing their desolation more clearly, and in
      some way bringing apprehension into my mood. And around them the horses,
      too, all standing with ears erect, watching me as I came&mdash;there was
      something about them; or was it the silence? For the silence which I had
      liked until now seemed suddenly to be made too great by the presence of
      the deserted buildings. And then the door of the stable opened, and men
      came out and stood, also watching me arrive. By the time I was dismounting
      more were there. It was senseless to feel as unpleasant as I did, and I
      strove to give to them a greeting that should sound easy. I told them that
      I hoped there was room for one more here to-night. Some of them had
      answered my greeting, but none of them answered this; and as I began to be
      sure that I recognized several of their strangely imperturbable faces, the
      Virginian came from the stable; and at that welcome sight my relief spoke
      out instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here, you see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do see.&rdquo; I looked hard at him, for in his voice was the same
      strangeness that I felt in everything around me. But he was looking at his
      companions. &ldquo;This gentleman is all right,&rdquo; he told them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said one whom I now knew that I had seen before at Sunk
      Creek; &ldquo;but he was not due to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor to-morrow,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor yet the day after,&rdquo; a third added.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian fell into his drawl. &ldquo;None of you was ever early for
      anything, I presume.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One retorted, laughing, &ldquo;Oh, we're not suspicioning you of complicity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And another, &ldquo;Not even when we remember how thick you and Steve used to
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever jokes they meant by this he did not receive as jokes. I saw
      something like a wince pass over his face, and a flush follow it. But he
      now spoke to me. &ldquo;We expected to be through before this,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I'm
      right sorry you have come to-night. I know you'd have preferred to keep
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want him to explain himself,&rdquo; put in one of the others. &ldquo;If he
      satisfies us, he's free to go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free to go away!&rdquo; I now exclaimed. But at the indulgence in their
      frontier smile I cooled down. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I don't know why my
      movements interest you so much. It's quite a compliment! May I get under
      shelter while I explain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No request could have been more natural, for the rain had now begun to
      fall in straight floods. Yet there was a pause before one of them said,
      &ldquo;He might as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian chose to say nothing more; but he walked beside me into the
      stable. Two men sat there together, and a third guarded them. At that
      sight I knew suddenly what I had stumbled upon; and on the impulse I
      murmured to the Virginian, &ldquo;You're hanging them to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kept his silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may have three guesses,&rdquo; said a man behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I did not need them. And in the recoil of my insight the clump of
      cottonwoods came into my mind, black and grim. No other trees high enough
      grew within ten miles. This, then, was the business that the Virginian's
      letter had so curtly mentioned. My eyes went into all corners of the
      stable, but no other prisoners were here. I half expected to see Trampas,
      and I half feared to see Shorty; for poor stupid Shorty's honesty had not
      been proof against frontier temptations, and he had fallen away from the
      company of his old friends. Often of late I had heard talk at Sunk Creek
      of breaking up a certain gang of horse and cattle thieves that stole in
      one Territory and sold in the next, and knew where to hide in the
      mountains between. And now it had come to the point; forces had been
      gathered, a long expedition made, and here they were, successful under the
      Virginian's lead, but a little later than their calculations. And here was
      I, a little too early, and a witness in consequence. My presence seemed a
      simple thing to account for; but when I had thus accounted for it, one of
      them said with good nature:&mdash; &ldquo;So you find us here, and we find you
      here. Which is the most surprised, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no telling,&rdquo; said I, keeping as amiable as I could; &ldquo;nor any
      telling which objects the most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there's no objection here. You're welcome to stay. But not welcome to
      go, I expect. He ain't welcome to go, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the answers that their faces gave him it was plain that I was not. &ldquo;Not
      till we are through,&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He needn't to see anything,&rdquo;' another added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better sleep late to-morrow morning,&rdquo; a third suggested to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not wish to stay here. I could have made some sort of camp apart
      from them before dark; but in the face of their needless caution I was
      helpless. I made no attempt to inquire what kind of spy they imagined I
      could be, what sort of rescue I could bring in this lonely country; my too
      early appearance seemed to be all that they looked at. And again my eyes
      sought the prisoners. Certainly there were only two. One was chewing
      tobacco, and talking now and then to his guard as if nothing were the
      matter. The other sat dull in silence, not moving his eyes; but his face
      worked, and I noticed how he continually moistened his dry lips. As I
      looked at these doomed prisoners, whose fate I was invited to sleep
      through to-morrow morning, the one who was chewing quietly nodded to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't remember me?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Steve! Steve of Medicine Bow! The pleasant Steve of my first
      evening in the West. Some change of beard had delayed my instant
      recognition of his face. Here he sat sentenced to die. A shock, chill and
      painful, deprived me of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no such weak feelings. &ldquo;Have yu' been to Medicine Bow lately?&rdquo; he
      inquired. &ldquo;That's getting to be quite a while ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assented. I should have liked to say something natural and kind, but
      words stuck against my will, and I stood awkward and ill at ease, noticing
      idly that the silent one wore a gray flannel shirt like mine. Steve looked
      me over, and saw in my pocket the newspaper which I had brought from the
      railroad and on which I had pencilled a few expenses. He asked me, Would I
      mind letting him have it for a while? And I gave it to him eagerly,
      begging him to keep it as long as he wanted. I was overeager in my
      embarrassment. &ldquo;You need not return it at all,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;those notes are
      nothing. Do keep it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave me a short glance and a smile. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I'll not
      need it beyond to-morrow morning.&rdquo; And he began to search through it.
      &ldquo;Jake's election is considered sure,&rdquo; he said to his companion, who made
      no response. &ldquo;Well, Fremont County owes it to Jake.&rdquo; And I left him
      interested in the local news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dead men I have seen not a few times, even some lying pale and terrible
      after violent ends, and the edge of this wears off; but I hope I shall
      never again have to be in the company with men waiting to be killed. By
      this time to-morrow the gray flannel shirt would be buttoned round a
      corpse. Until what moment would Steve chew? Against such fancies as these
      I managed presently to barricade my mind, but I made a plea to be allowed
      to pass the night elsewhere, and I suggested the adjacent cabin. By their
      faces I saw that my words merely helped their distrust of me. The cabin
      leaked too much, they said; I would sleep drier here. One man gave it to
      me more directly: &ldquo;If you figured on camping in this stable, what has
      changed your mind?&rdquo; How could I tell them that I shrunk from any contact
      with what they were doing, although I knew that only so could justice be
      dealt in this country? Their wholesome frontier nerves knew nothing of
      such refinements.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Virginian understood part of it. &ldquo;I am right sorry for your
      annoyance,&rdquo; he said. And now I noticed he was under a constraint very
      different from the ease of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the twelve hours' ride my bones were hungry for rest. I spread my
      blankets on some straw in a stall by myself and rolled up in them; yet I
      lay growing broader awake, every inch of weariness stricken from my
      excited senses. For a while they sat over their councils, whispering
      cautiously, so that I was made curious to hear them by not being able; was
      it the names of Trampas and Shorty that were once or twice spoken&mdash;I
      could not be sure. I heard the whisperers cease and separate. I heard
      their boots as they cast them off upon the ground. And I heard the
      breathing of slumber begin and grow in the interior silence. To one after
      one sleep came, but not to me. Outside, the dull fall of the rain beat
      evenly, and in some angle dripped the spouting pulses of a leak. Sometimes
      a cold air blew in, bearing with it the keen wet odor of the sage-brush.
      On hundreds of other nights this perfume had been my last waking
      remembrance; it had seemed to help drowsiness; and now I lay staring,
      thinking of this. Twice through the hours the thieves shifted their
      positions with clumsy sounds, exchanging muted words with their guard. So,
      often, had I heard other companions move and mutter in the darkness and
      lie down again. It was the very naturalness and usualness of every fact of
      the night,&mdash;the stable straw, the rain outside, my familiar blankets,
      the cool visits of the wind,&mdash;and with all this the thought of Steve
      chewing and the man in the gray flannel shirt, that made the hours
      unearthly and strung me tight with suspense. And at last I heard some one
      get up and begin to dress. In a little while I saw light suddenly through
      my closed eyelids, and then darkness shut again abruptly upon them. They
      had swung in a lantern and found me by mistake. I was the only one they
      did not wish to rouse. Moving and quiet talking set up around me, and they
      began to go out of the stable. At the gleams of new daylight which they
      let in my thoughts went to the clump of cottonwoods, and I lay still with
      hands and feet growing steadily cold. Now it was going to happen. I
      wondered how they would do it; one instance had been described to me by a
      witness, but that was done from a bridge, and there had been but a single
      victim. This morning, would one have to wait and see the other go through
      with it first?
    </p>
    <p>
      The smell of smoke reached me, and next the rattle of tin dishes.
      Breakfast was something I had forgotten, and one of them was cooking it
      now in the dry shelter of the stable. He was alone, because the talking
      and the steps were outside the stable, and I could hear the sounds of
      horses being driven into the corral and saddled. Then I perceived that the
      coffee was ready, and almost immediately the cook called them. One came
      in, shutting the door behind him as he reentered, which the rest as they
      followed imitated; for at each opening of the door I saw the light of day
      leap into the stable and heard the louder sounds of the rain. Then the
      sound and the light would again be shut out, until some one at length
      spoke out bluntly, bidding the door be left open on account of the smoke.
      What were they hiding from? he asked. The runaways that had escaped? A
      laugh followed this sally, and the door was left open. Thus I learned that
      there had been more thieves than the two that were captured. It gave a
      little more ground for their suspicion about me and my anxiety to pass the
      night elsewhere. It cost nothing to detain me, and they were taking no
      chances, however remote.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fresh air and the light now filled the stable, and I lay listening
      while their breakfast brought more talk from them. They were more at ease
      now than was I, who had nothing to do but carry out my role of slumber in
      the stall; they spoke in a friendly, ordinary way, as if this were like
      every other morning of the week to them. They addressed the prisoners with
      a sort of fraternal kindness, not bringing them pointedly into the
      conversation, nor yet pointedly leaving them out. I made out that they
      must all be sitting round the breakfast together, those who had to die and
      those who had to kill them. The Virginian I never heard speak. But I heard
      the voice of Steve; he discussed with his captors the sundry points of his
      capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember a haystack?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Away up the south fork of Gros
      Ventre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was Thursday afternoon,&rdquo; said one of the captors. &ldquo;There was a
      shower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It rained. We had you fooled that time. I was laying on the ledge
      above to report your movements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several of them laughed. &ldquo;We thought you were over on Spread Creek then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I figured you thought so by the trail you left after the stack. Saturday
      we watched you turn your back on us up Spread Creek. We were snug among
      the trees the other side of Snake River. That was another time we had you
      fooled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed again at their own expense. I have heard men pick to pieces a
      hand of whist with more antagonism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steve continued: &ldquo;Would we head for Idaho? Would we swing back over the
      Divide? You didn't know which! And when we generalled you on to that band
      of horses you thought was the band you were hunting&mdash;ah, we were a
      strong combination!&rdquo; He broke off with the first touch of bitterness I had
      felt in his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is any stronger than its weakest point.&rdquo; It was the Virginian who
      said this, and it was the first word he had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said Steve. His tone in addressing the Virginian was so
      different, so curt, that I supposed he took the weakest point to mean
      himself. But the others now showed me that I was wrong in this
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; one said. &ldquo;Its weakest point is where a rope or a gang of men
      is going to break when the strain comes. And you was linked with a poor
      partner, Steve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right I was,&rdquo; said the prisoner, back in his easy, casual voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have got yourself separated from him, Steve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the prisoner, moodily. &ldquo;I'm sitting here
      because one of us blundered.&rdquo; He cursed the blunderer. &ldquo;Lighting his fool
      fire queered the whole deal,&rdquo; he added. As he again heavily cursed the
      blunderer, the others murmured to each other various I told you so's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd never have built that fire, Steve,&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that when we spied the smoke,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;I said, 'That's none
      of Steve's work, lighting fires and revealing to us their whereabouts.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It struck me that they were plying Steve with compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty hard to have the fool get away and you get caught,&rdquo; a third
      suggested. At this they seemed to wait. I felt something curious in all
      this last talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, did he get away?&rdquo; said the prisoner, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again they waited; and a new voice spoke huskily:&mdash; &ldquo;I built that
      fire, boys.&rdquo; It was the prisoner in the gray flannel shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late, Ed,&rdquo; they told him kindly. &ldquo;You ain't a good liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you laugh, Steve?&rdquo; said some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the things I notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning Ed was pretty slow in backing up your play? The joke is really on
      you, Steve. You'd ought never to have cursed the fire-builder if you
      wanted us to believe he was present. But we'd not have done much to
      Shorty, even if we had caught him. All he wants is to be scared good and
      hard, and he'll go back into virtuousness, which is his nature when not
      travelling with Trampas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steve's voice sounded hard now. &ldquo;You have caught Ed and me. That should
      satisfy you for one gather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we think different, Steve. Trampas escaping leaves this thing
      unfinished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Trampas escaped too, did he?&rdquo; said the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Steve, Trampas escaped&mdash;this time; and Shorty with him&mdash;this
      time. We know it most as well as if we'd seen them go. And we're glad
      Shorty is loose, for he'll build another fire or do some other foolishness
      next time, and that's the time we'll get Trampas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their talk drifted to other points, and I lay thinking of the skirmish
      that had played beneath the surface of their banter. Yes, the joke, as
      they put it, was on Steve. He had lost one point in the game to them. They
      were playing for names. He, being a chivalrous thief, was playing to hide
      names. They could only, among several likely confederates, guess Trampas
      and Shorty. So it had been a slip for him to curse the man who built the
      fire. At least, they so held it. For, they with subtlety reasoned, one
      curses the absent. And I agreed with them that Ed did not know how to lie
      well; he should have at once claimed the disgrace of having spoiled the
      expedition. If Shorty was the blunderer, then certainly Trampas was the
      other man; for the two were as inseparable as don and master. Trampas had
      enticed Shorty away from good, and trained him in evil. It now struck me
      that after his single remark the Virginian had been silent throughout
      their shrewd discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the other prisoner that I heard them next address. &ldquo;You don't eat
      any breakfast, Ed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brace up, Ed. Look at Steve, how hardy he eats!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Ed, it seemed, wanted no breakfast. And the tin dishes rattled as they
      were gathered and taken to be packed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink this coffee, anyway,&rdquo; another urged; &ldquo;you'll feel warmer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words almost made it seem like my own execution. My whole body
      turned cold in company with the prisoner's, and as if with a clank the
      situation tightened throughout my senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon if every one's ready we'll start.&rdquo; It was the Virginian's voice
      once more, and different from the rest. I heard them rise at his bidding,
      and I put the blanket over my head. I felt their tread as they walked out,
      passing my stall. The straw that was half under me and half out in the
      stable was stirred as by something heavy dragged or half lifted along over
      it. &ldquo;Look out, you're hurting Ed's arm,&rdquo; one said to another, as the steps
      with tangled sounds passed slowly out. I heard another among those who
      followed say, &ldquo;Poor Ed couldn't swallow his coffee.&rdquo; Outside they began
      getting on their horses; and next their hoofs grew distant, until all was
      silence round the stable except the dull, even falling of the rain.

    <h2>
      XXXI. THE COTTONWOODS
    </h2>
    <p>
      I do not know how long I stayed there alone. It was the Virginian who came
      back, and as he stood at the foot of my blankets his eye, after meeting
      mine full for a moment, turned aside. I had never seen him look as he did
      now, not even in Pitchstone Canyon when we came upon the bodies of Hank
      and his wife. Until this moment we had found no chance of speaking
      together, except in the presence of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to be raining still,&rdquo; I began after a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It's a wet spell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared out of the door, smoothing his mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was again I that spoke. &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He brooded over his watch. &ldquo;Twelve minutes to seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose and stood drawing on my clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fire's out,&rdquo; said he; and he assembled some new sticks over the
      ashes. Presently he looked round with a cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that for me,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've a long ride,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I've crackers in my pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My boots being pulled on, I walked to the door and watched the clouds.
      &ldquo;They seem as if they might lift,&rdquo; I said. And I took out my watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A quarter of&mdash;it's run down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I wound it he seemed to be consulting his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten minutes past seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I was setting my watch he slowly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steve wound his all regular. I had to night-guard him till two.&rdquo; His
      speech was like that of one in a trance: so, at least, it sounds in my
      memory to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I looked at the weather and the rainy immensity of the plain. The
      foot-hills eastward where we were going were a soft yellow. Over the
      gray-green sage-brush moved shapeless places of light&mdash;not yet the
      uncovered sunlight, but spots where the storm was wearing thin; and
      wandering streams of warmth passed by slowly in the surrounding air. As I
      watched the clouds and the earth, my eyes chanced to fall on the distant
      clump of cottonwoods. Vapors from the enfeebled storm floated round them,
      and they were indeed far away; but I came inside and began rolling up my
      blankets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not change your mind?&rdquo; said the Virginian by the fire. &ldquo;It is
      thirty-five miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head, feeling a certain shame that he should see how unnerved I
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swallowed a hot cupful, and after it sat thinking; and presently he
      passed his hand across his brow, shutting his eyes. Again he poured out a
      cup, and emptying this, rose abruptly to his feet as if shaking himself
      free from something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's pack and quit here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our horses were in the corral and our belongings in the shelter of what
      had been once the cabin at this forlorn place. He collected them in
      silence while I saddled my own animal, and in silence we packed the two
      packhorses, and threw the diamond hitch, and hauled tight the slack, damp
      ropes. Soon we had mounted, and as we turned into the trail I gave a look
      back at my last night's lodging.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian noticed me. &ldquo;Good-by forever!&rdquo; he interpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, I hope so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; he confessed. And these were our first natural words this
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will go well,&rdquo; said I, holding my flask out to him; and both of us
      took some, and felt easier for it and the natural words.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an hour we had been shirking real talk, holding fast to the weather,
      or anything, and all the while that silent thing we were keeping off spoke
      plainly in the air around us and in every syllable that we uttered. But
      now we were going to get away from it; leave it behind in the stable, and
      set ourselves free from it by talking it out. Already relief had begun to
      stir in my spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never did this before,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I never had it to do.&rdquo; He was riding beside me, looking down at his
      saddle-horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think I should ever be able,&rdquo; I pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Defiance sounded in his answer. &ldquo;I would do it again this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't mean that. It's all right here. There's no other way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would do it all over again the same this morning. Just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, so should I&mdash;if I could do it at all.&rdquo; I still thought he was
      justifying their justice to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer as he rode along, looking all the while at his saddle.
      But again he passed his hand over his forehead with that frown and
      shutting of the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to be sure I should behave myself if I were condemned,&rdquo; I
      said next. For it now came to me&mdash;which should I resemble? Could I
      read the newspaper, and be interested in county elections, and discuss
      coming death as if I had lost a game of cards? Or would they have to drag
      me out? That poor wretch in the gray flannel shirt&mdash;&ldquo;It was bad in
      the stable,&rdquo; I said aloud. For an after-shiver of it went through me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third time his hand brushed his forehead, and I ventured some sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid your head aches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to keep seeing Steve,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steve!&rdquo; I was astounded. &ldquo;Why he&mdash;why all I saw of him was splendid.
      Since it had to be. It was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; Ed. You're thinking about him. I'd forgot him. So you didn't
      enjoy Ed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this I looked at him blankly. &ldquo;It isn't possible that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he cut me short with a laugh almost savage. &ldquo;You needn't to worry
      about Steve. He stayed game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What then had been the matter that he should keep seeing Steve&mdash;that
      his vision should so obliterate from him what I still shivered at, and so
      shake him now? For he seemed to be growing more stirred as I grew less. I
      asked him no further questions, however, and we went on for several
      minutes, he brooding always in the same fashion, until he resumed with the
      hard indifference that had before surprised me:&mdash; &ldquo;So Ed gave you
      feelings! Dumb ague and so forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt we're not made the same way,&rdquo; I retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took no notice of this. &ldquo;And you'd have been more comfortable if he'd
      acted same as Steve did. It cert'nly was bad seeing Ed take it that way, I
      reckon. And you didn't see him when the time came for business. Well,
      here's what it is: a man may be such a confirmed miscreant that killing's
      the only cure for him; but still he's your own species, and you don't want
      to have him fall around and grab your laigs and show you his fear naked.
      It makes you feel ashamed. So Ed gave you feelings, and Steve made
      everything right easy for you!&rdquo; There was irony in his voice as he
      surveyed me, but it fell away at once into sadness. &ldquo;Both was miscreants.
      But if Steve had played the coward, too, it would have been a whole heap
      easier for me.&rdquo; He paused before adding, &ldquo;And Steve was not a miscreant
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice had trembled, and I felt the deep emotion that seemed to gain
      upon him now that action was over and he had nothing to do but think. And
      his view was simple enough: you must die brave. Failure is a sort of
      treason to the brotherhood, and forfeits pity. It was Steve's perfect
      bearing that had caught his heart so that he forgot even his scorn of the
      other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was by no means all that was to come. He harked back to that
      notion of a prisoner helping to make it easy for his executioner. &ldquo;Easy
      plumb to the end,&rdquo; he pursued, his mind reviewing the acts of the morning.
      &ldquo;Why, he tried to give me your newspaper. I didn't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; I said hastily. &ldquo;I had finished with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he took dying as naturally as he took living. Like a man should.
      Like I hope to.&rdquo; Again he looked at the pictures in his mind. &ldquo;No
      play-acting nor last words. He just told good-by to the boys as we led his
      horse under the limb&mdash;you needn't to look so dainty,&rdquo; he broke off.
      &ldquo;You ain't going to get any more shocking particulars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I'm white-livered,&rdquo; I said with a species of laugh. &ldquo;I never crowd
      and stare when somebody is hurt in the street. I get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought this over. &ldquo;You don't mean all of that. You'd not have spoke
      just that way about crowding and staring if you thought well of them that
      stare. Staring ain't courage; it's trashy curiosity. Now you did not have
      this thing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had stretched out his hand to point, but it fell, and his utterance
      stopped, and he jerked his horse to a stand. My nerves sprang like a wire
      at his suddenness, and I looked where he was looking. There were the
      cottonwoods, close in front of us. As we had travelled and talked we had
      forgotten them. Now they were looming within a hundred yards; and our
      trail lay straight through them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go around them,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had come back from our circuit into the trail he continued: &ldquo;You
      did not have that thing to do. But a man goes through with his
      responsibilities&mdash;and I reckon you could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;How about Ed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was not a man, though we thought he was till this. Steve and I started
      punching cattle together at the Bordeaux outfit, north of Cheyenne. We did
      everything together in those days&mdash;work and play. Six years ago.
      Steve had many good points onced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We must have gone two miles before he spoke again. &ldquo;You prob'ly didn't
      notice Steve? I mean the way he acted to me?&rdquo; It was a question, but he
      did not wait for my answer. &ldquo;Steve never said a word to me all through. He
      shunned it. And you saw how neighborly he talked to the other boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have they all gone?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at me. &ldquo;It cert'nly is lonesome now, for a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know you felt it,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feel it!&mdash;they've went to the railroad. Three of them are witnesses
      in a case at Evanston, and the Judge wants our outfit at Medicine Bow.
      Steve shunned me. Did he think I was going back on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if he did? You were not. And so nobody's going to Wind River but
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Did you notice Steve would not give us any information about Shorty?
      That was right. I would have acted that way, too.&rdquo; Thus, each time, he
      brought me back to the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was now shining warm during two or three minutes together, and
      gulfs of blue opened in the great white clouds. These moved and met among
      each other, and parted, like hands spread out, slowly weaving a spell of
      sleep over the day after the wakeful night storm. The huge contours of the
      earth lay basking and drying, and not one living creature, bird or beast,
      was in sight. Quiet was returning to my revived spirits, but there was
      none for the Virginian. And as he reasoned matters out aloud, his mood
      grew more overcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a friend, and his ways are your ways. You travel together, you
      spree together confidentially, and you suit each other down to the ground.
      Then one day you find him putting his iron on another man's calf. You tell
      him fair and square those ways have never been your ways and ain't going
      to be your ways. Well, that does not change him any, for it seems he's
      disturbed over getting rich quick and being a big man in the Territory.
      And the years go on, until you are foreman of Judge Henry's ranch and he&mdash;is
      dangling back in the cottonwoods. What can he claim? Who made the choice?
      He cannot say, 'Here is my old friend that I would have stood by.' Can he
      say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he didn't say it,&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He shunned me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Suppose while you were on guard he had whispered, 'Get
      me off'&mdash;would you have done it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; said the Virginian, hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what do you want?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;What did you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not answer me&mdash;but I had not answered him, I saw; so I
      pushed it farther. &ldquo;Did you want indorsement from the man you were
      hanging? That's asking a little too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he had now another confusion. &ldquo;Steve stood by Shorty,&rdquo; he said
      musingly. &ldquo;It was Shorty's mistake cost him his life, but all the same he
      didn't want us to catch&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mixing things,&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;I never heard you mix things
      before. And it was not Shorty's mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He showed momentary interest. &ldquo;Whose then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mistake of whoever took a fool into their enterprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's correct. Well, Trampas took Shorty in, and Steve would not tell on
      him either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I still tried it, saying, &ldquo;They were all in the same boat.&rdquo; But logic was
      useless; he had lost his bearings in a fog of sentiment. He knew, knew
      passionately, that he had done right; but the silence of his old friend to
      him through those last hours left a sting that no reasoning could assuage.
      &ldquo;He told good-by to the rest of the boys; but not to me.&rdquo; And nothing that
      I could point out in common sense turned him from the thread of his own
      argument. He worked round the circle again to self-justification. &ldquo;Was it
      him I was deserting? Was not the deserting done by him the day I spoke my
      mind about stealing calves? I have kept my ways the same. He is the one
      that took to new ones. The man I used to travel with is not the man back
      there. Same name, to be sure. And same body. But different in&mdash;and
      yet he had the memory! You can't never change your memory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a sob. It was the first I had ever heard from him, and before I
      knew what I was doing I had reined my horse up to his and put my arm
      around his shoulders. I had no sooner touched him than he was utterly
      overcome. &ldquo;I knew Steve awful well,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we had actually come to change places; for early in the morning he
      had been firm while I was unnerved, while now it was I who attempted to
      steady and comfort him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the sense to keep silent, and presently he shook my hand, not
      looking at me as he did so. He was always very shy of demonstration. And
      he took to patting the neck of his pony. &ldquo;You Monte hawss,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you
      think you are wise, but there's a lot of things you don't savvy.&rdquo; Then he
      made a new beginning of talk between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is kind of pitiful about Shorty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very pitiful,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know about him?&rdquo; the Virginian asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know there's no real harm in him, and some real good, and that he has
      not got the brains necessary to be a horse thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so. That's very true. Trampas has led him in deeper than his
      stature can stand. Now back East you can be middling and get along. But if
      you go to try a thing on in this Western country, you've got to do it
      WELL. You've got to deal cyards WELL; you've got to steal WELL; and if you
      claim to be quick with your gun, you must be quick, for you're a public
      temptation, and some man will not resist trying to prove he is the
      quicker. You must break all the Commandments WELL in this Western country,
      and Shorty should have stayed in Brooklyn, for he will be a novice his
      livelong days. You don't know about him? He has told me his circumstances.
      He don't remember his father, and it was like he could have claimed three
      or four. And I expect his mother was not much interested in him before or
      after he was born. He ran around, and when he was eighteen he got to be
      help to a grocery man. But a girl he ran with kept taking all his pay and
      teasing him for more, and so one day the grocery man caught Shorty robbing
      his till, and fired him. There wasn't no one to tell good-by to, for the
      girl had to go to the country to see her aunt, she said. So Shorty hung
      around the store and kissed the grocery cat good-by. He'd been used to
      feeding the cat, and she'd sit in his lap and purr, he told me. He sends
      money back to that girl now. This hyeh country is no country for Shorty,
      for he will be a conspicuous novice all his days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he'll prefer honesty after his narrow shave,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Virginian shook his head. &ldquo;Trampas has got hold of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day was now all blue above, and all warm and dry beneath. We had begun
      to wind in and rise among the first slopes of the foot-hills, and we had
      talked ourselves into silence. At the first running water we made a long
      nooning, and I slept on the bare ground. My body was lodged so fast and
      deep in slumber that when the Virginian shook me awake I could not come
      back to life at once; it was the clump of cottonwoods, small and far out
      in the plain below us, that recalled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll not be watching us much longer,&rdquo; said the Virginian. He made it a
      sort of joke; but I knew that both of us were glad when presently we rode
      into a steeper country, and among its folds and carvings lost all sight of
      the plain. He had not slept, I found. His explanation was that the packs
      needed better balancing, and after that he had gone up and down the stream
      on the chance of trout. But his haunted eyes gave me the real reason&mdash;they
      spoke of Steve, no matter what he spoke of; it was to be no short thing
      with him.

    <h2>
      XXXII. SUPERSTITION TRAIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      We did not make thirty-five miles that day, nor yet twenty-five, for he
      had let me sleep. We made an early camp and tried some unsuccessful
      fishing, over which he was cheerful, promising trout to-morrow when we
      should be higher among the mountains. He never again touched or came near
      the subject that was on his mind, but while I sat writing my diary, he
      went off to his horse Monte, and I could hear that he occasionally talked
      to that friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day we swung southward from what is known to many as the Conant
      trail, and headed for that short cut through the Tetons which is known to
      but a few. Bitch Creek was the name of the stream we now followed, and
      here there was such good fishing that we idled; and the horses and I at
      least enjoyed ourselves. For they found fresh pastures and shade in the
      now plentiful woods; and the mountain odors and the mountain heights were
      enough for me when the fish refused to rise. This road of ours now became
      the road which the pursuit had taken before the capture. Going along, I
      noticed the footprints of many hoofs, rain-blurred but recent, and these
      were the tracks of the people I had met in the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can notice Monte's,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;He is the only one that has
      his hind feet shod. There's several trails from this point down to where
      we have come from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We mounted now over a long slant of rock, smooth and of wide extent. Above
      us it went up easily into a little side canyon, but ahead, where our way
      was, it grew so steep that we got off and led our horses. This brought us
      to the next higher level of the mountain, a space of sagebrush more open,
      where the rain-washed tracks appeared again in the softer ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one has been here since the rain,&rdquo; I called to the Virginian, who
      was still on the rock, walking up behind the packhorses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since the rain!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That's not two days yet.&rdquo; He came and
      examined the footprints. &ldquo;A man and a hawss,&rdquo; he said, frowning. &ldquo;Going
      the same way we are. How did he come to pass us, and us not see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the other trails,&rdquo; I reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but there's not many that knows them. They are pretty rough trails.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than this one we're taking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much; only how does he come to know any of them? And why don't he
      take the Conant trail that's open and easy and not much longer? One man
      and a hawss. I don't see who he is or what he wants here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably a prospector,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one outfit of prospectors has ever been here, and they claimed there
      was no mineral-bearing rock in these parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We got back into our saddles with the mystery unsolved. To the Virginian
      it was a greater one, apparently, than to me; why should one have to
      account for every stray traveller in the mountains?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's queer, too,&rdquo; said the Virginian. He was now riding in front of me,
      and he stopped, looking down at the trail. &ldquo;Don't you notice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did not strike me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he keeps walking beside his hawss; he don't get on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now we, of course, had mounted at the beginning of the better trail after
      the steep rock, and that was quite half a mile back. Still, I had a
      natural explanation. &ldquo;He's leading a packhorse. He's a poor trapper, and
      walks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Packhorses ain't usually shod before and behind,&rdquo; said the Virginian; and
      sliding to the ground he touched the footprints. &ldquo;They are not four hours
      old,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;This bank's in shadow by one o'clock, and the sun has not
      cooked them dusty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We continued on our way; and although it seemed no very particular thing
      to me that a man should choose to walk and lead his horse for a while,&mdash;I
      often did so to limber my muscles,&mdash;nevertheless I began to catch the
      Virginian's uncertain feeling about this traveller whose steps had
      appeared on our path in mid-journey, as if he had alighted from the
      mid-air, and to remind myself that he had come over the great face of rock
      from another trail and thus joined us, and that indigent trappers are to
      be found owning but a single horse and leading him with their belongings
      through the deepest solitudes of the mountains&mdash;none of this quite
      brought back to me the comfort which had been mine since we left the
      cottonwoods out of sight down in the plain. Hence I called out sharply,
      &ldquo;What's the matter now?&rdquo; when the Virginian suddenly stopped his horse
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at the trail, and then he very slowly turned round in his
      saddle and stared back steadily at me. &ldquo;There's two of them,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must know whether it's two horses or two men,&rdquo; I said, almost
      angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to this he made no answer, sitting quite still on his horse and
      contemplating the ground. The silence was fastening on me like a spell,
      and I spurred my horse impatiently forward to see for myself. The
      footprints of two men were there in the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to that?&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;Kind of ridiculous, ain't
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very quaint,&rdquo; I answered, groping for the explanation. There was no rock
      here to walk over and step from into the softer trail. These second steps
      came more out of the air than the first. And my brain played me the evil
      trick of showing me a dead man in a gray flannel shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's two, you see, travelling with one hawss, and they take turns riding
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo; I exclaimed; and we went along for a few paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; said the Virginian, as the trail proved him right.
      &ldquo;Number one has got on. My God, what's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At a crashing in the woods very close to us we both flung round and caught
      sight of a vanishing elk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It left us confronted, smiling a little, and sounding each other with our
      eyes. &ldquo;Well, we didn't need him for meat,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A spike-horn, wasn't it?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just a spike-horn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a while now as we rode we kept up a cheerful conversation about elk.
      We wondered if we should meet many more close to the trail like this; but
      it was not long before our words died away. We had come into a veritable
      gulf of mountain peaks, sharp at their bare summits like teeth, holding
      fields of snow lower down, and glittering still in full day up there,
      while down among our pines and parks the afternoon was growing sombre. All
      the while the fresh hoofprints of the horse and the fresh footprints of
      the man preceded us. In the trees, and in the opens, across the levels,
      and up the steeps, they were there. And so they were not four hours old!
      Were they so much? Might we not, round some turn, come upon the makers of
      them? I began to watch for this. And again my brain played me an evil
      trick, against which I found myself actually reasoning thus: if they took
      turns riding, then walking must tire them as it did me or any man. And
      besides, there was a horse. With such thoughts I combated the fancy that
      those footprints were being made immediately in front of us all the while,
      and that they were the only sign of any presence which our eyes could see.
      But my fancy overcame my thoughts. It was shame only which held me from
      asking this question of the Virginian: Had one horse served in both cases
      of Justice down at the cottonwoods? I wondered about this. One horse&mdash;or
      had the strangling nooses dragged two saddles empty at the same signal?
      Most likely; and therefore these people up here&mdash;Was I going back to
      the nursery? I brought myself up short. And I told myself to be steady;
      there lurked in this brain-process which was going on beneath my reason a
      threat worse than the childish apprehensions it created. I reminded myself
      that I was a man grown, twenty-five years old, and that I must not merely
      seem like one, but feel like one. &ldquo;You're not afraid of the dark, I
      suppose?&rdquo; This I uttered aloud, unwittingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started; but it was only the Virginian behind me. &ldquo;Oh, nothing. The air
      is getting colder up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had presently a great relief. We came to a place where again this trail
      mounted so abruptly that we once more got off to lead our horses. So
      likewise had our predecessors done; and as I watched the two different
      sets of footprints, I observed something and hastened to speak of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One man is much heavier than the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was hoping I'd not have to tell you that,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're always ahead of me! Well, still my education is progressing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. You'll equal an Injun if you keep on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was good to be facetious; and I smiled to myself as I trudged upward.
      We came off the steep place, leaving the canyon beneath us, and took to
      horseback. And as we proceeded over the final gentle slant up to the rim
      of the great basin that was set among the peaks, the Virginian was jocular
      once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pounds has got on,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and Ounces is walking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I glanced over my shoulder at him, and he nodded as he fixed the
      weather-beaten crimson handkerchief round his neck. Then he threw a stone
      at a pack animal that was delaying on the trail. &ldquo;Damn your buckskin
      hide,&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;You can view the scenery from the top.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so natural, sitting loose in the saddle, and cursing in his gentle
      voice, that I laughed to think what visions I had been harboring. The two
      dead men riding one horse through the mountains vanished, and I came back
      to every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think we'll catch up with those people?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not likely. They're travelling about the same gait we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ounces ought to be the best walker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up hill, yes. But Pounds will go down a-foggin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We gained the rim of the basin. It lay below us, a great cup of country,&mdash;rocks,
      woods, opens, and streams. The tall peaks rose like spires around it,
      magnificent and bare in the last of the sun; and we surveyed this upper
      world, letting our animals get breath. Our bleak, crumbled rim ran like a
      rampart between the towering tops, a half circle of five miles or six,
      very wide in some parts, and in some shrinking to a scanty foothold, as
      here. Here our trail crossed over it between two eroded and fantastic
      shapes of stone, like mushrooms, or misshapen heads on pikes. Banks of
      snow spread up here against the black rocks, but half an hour would see us
      descended to the green and the woods. I looked down, both of us looked
      down, but our forerunners were not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll be camping somewhere in this basin, though,&rdquo; said the Virginian,
      staring at the dark pines. &ldquo;They have not come this trail by accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cold little wind blew down between our stone shapes, and upward again,
      eddying. And round a corner upward with it came fluttering a leaf of
      newspaper, and caught against an edge close to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the latest?&rdquo; inquired the Virginian from his horse. For I had
      dismounted, and had picked up the leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to be interesting,&rdquo; I next heard him say. &ldquo;Can't you tell a man
      what's making your eyes bug out so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; my voice replied to him, and it sounded like some stranger speaking
      lightly near by; &ldquo;oh, yes! Decidedly interesting.&rdquo; My voice mimicked his
      pronunciation. &ldquo;It's quite the latest, I imagine. You had better read it
      yourself.&rdquo; And I handed it to him with a smile, watching his countenance,
      while my brain felt as if clouds were rushing through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw his eyes quietly run the headings over. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he inquired, after
      scanning it on both sides. &ldquo;I don't seem to catch the excitement. Fremont
      County is going to hold elections. I see they claim Jake&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's mine,&rdquo; I cut him off. &ldquo;My own paper. Those are my pencil marks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not think that a microscope could have discerned a change in his
      face. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he commented, holding the paper, and fixing it with a critical
      eye. &ldquo;You mean this is the one you lent Steve, and he wanted to give me to
      give back to you. And so them are your own marks.&rdquo; For a moment more he
      held it judicially, as I have seen men hold a contract upon whose terms
      they were finally passing. &ldquo;Well, you have got it back now, anyway.&rdquo; And
      he handed it to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a piece of it!&rdquo; I exclaimed, always lightly. And as I took it from
      him his hand chanced to touch mine. It was cold as ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ain't through readin' the rest,&rdquo; he explained easily. &ldquo;Don't you
      throw it away! After they've taken such trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I wonder if it's Pounds or Ounces I'm indebted
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus we made further merriment as we rode down into the great basin.
      Before us, the horse and boot tracks showed plain in the soft slough where
      melted snow ran half the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it's a paper chase,&rdquo; said the Virginian, &ldquo;they'll drop no more along
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless it gets dark,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll camp before that. Maybe we'll see their fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We did not see their fire. We descended in the chill silence, while the
      mushroom rocks grew far and the sombre woods approached. By a stream we
      got off where two banks sheltered us; for a bleak wind cut down over the
      crags now and then, making the pines send out a great note through the
      basin, like breakers in a heavy sea. But we made cosey in the tent. We
      pitched the tent this night, and I was glad to have it shut out the
      mountain peaks. They showed above the banks where we camped; and in the
      starlight their black shapes rose stark against the sky. They, with the
      pines and the wind, were a bedroom too unearthly this night. And as soon
      as our supper dishes were washed we went inside to our lantern and our
      game of cribbage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is snug,&rdquo; said the Virginian, as we played. &ldquo;That wind don't get
      down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smoking is snug, too,&rdquo; said I. And we marked our points for an hour, with
      no words save about the cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be pretty near glad when we get out of these mountains,&rdquo; said the
      Virginian. &ldquo;They're most too big.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pines had altogether ceased; but their silence was as tremendous as
      their roar had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, though,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;There's times when the plains can be
      awful big, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently we finished a hand, and he said, &ldquo;Let me see that paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat reading it apparently through, while I arranged my blankets to make
      a warm bed. Then, since the paper continued to absorb him, I got myself
      ready, and slid between my blankets for the night. &ldquo;You'll need another
      candle soon in that lantern,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the paper down. &ldquo;I would do it all over again,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;The
      whole thing just the same. He knowed the customs of the country, and he
      played the game. No call to blame me for the customs of the country. You
      leave other folks' cattle alone, or you take the consequences, and it was
      all known to Steve from the start. Would he have me take the Judge's wages
      and give him the wink? He must have changed a heap from the Steve I knew
      if he expected that. I don't believe he expected that. He knew well enough
      the only thing that would have let him off would have been a regular jury.
      For the thieves have got hold of the juries in Johnson County. I would do
      it all over, just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expiring flame leaped in the lantern, and fell blue. He broke off in
      his words as if to arrange the light, but did not, sitting silent instead,
      just visible, and seeming to watch the death struggle of the flame. I
      could find nothing to say to him, and I believed he was now winning his
      way back to serenity by himself. He kept his outward man so nearly natural
      that I forgot about that cold touch of his hand, and never guessed how far
      out from reason the tide of emotion was even now whirling him. &ldquo;I remember
      at Cheyenne onced,&rdquo; he resumed. And he told me of a Thanksgiving visit to
      town that he had made with Steve. &ldquo;We was just colts then,&rdquo; he said. He
      dwelt on their coltish doings, their adventures sought and wrought in the
      perfect fellowship of youth. &ldquo;For Steve and me most always hunted in
      couples back in them gamesome years,&rdquo; he explained. And he fell into the
      elemental talk of sex, such talk as would be an elk's or tiger's; and
      spoken so by him, simply and naturally, as we speak of the seasons, or of
      death, or of any actuality, it was without offense. It would be offense
      should I repeat it. Then, abruptly ending these memories of himself and
      Steve, he went out of the tent, and I heard him dragging a log to the
      fire. When it had blazed up, there on the tent wall was his shadow and
      that of the log where he sat with his half-broken heart. And all the while
      I supposed he was master of himself, and self-justified against Steve's
      omission to bid him good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must have fallen asleep before he returned, for I remember nothing
      except waking and finding him in his blankets beside me. The fire shadow
      was gone, and gray, cold light was dimly on the tent. He slept restlessly,
      and his forehead was ploughed by lines of pain. While I looked at him he
      began to mutter, and suddenly started up with violence. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried
      out; &ldquo;no! Just the same!&rdquo; and thus wakened himself, staring. &ldquo;What's the
      matter?&rdquo; he demanded. He was slow in getting back to where we were; and
      full consciousness found him sitting up with his eyes fixed on mine. They
      were more haunted than they had been at all, and his next speech came
      straight from his dream. &ldquo;Maybe you'd better quit me. This ain't your
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed. &ldquo;Why, what is the trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes still intently fixed on mine. &ldquo;Do you think if we changed our
      trail we could lose them from us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was framing a jocose reply about Ounces being a good walker, when the
      sound of hoofs rushing in the distance stopped me, and he ran out of the
      tent with his rifle. When I followed with mine he was up the bank, and all
      his powers alert. But nothing came out of the dimness save our three
      stampeded horses. They crashed over fallen timber and across the open to
      where their picketed comrade grazed at the end of his rope. By him they
      came to a stand, and told him, I suppose, what they had seen; for all four
      now faced in the same direction, looking away into the mysterious dawn. We
      likewise stood peering, and my rifle barrel felt cold in my hand. The dawn
      was all we saw, the inscrutable dawn, coming and coming through the black
      pines and the gray open of the basin. There above lifted the peaks, no sun
      yet on them, and behind us our stream made a little tinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bear, I suppose,&rdquo; said I, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      His strange look fixed me again, and then his eyes went to the horses.
      &ldquo;They smell things we can't smell,&rdquo; said he, very slowly. &ldquo;Will you prove
      to me they don't see things we can't see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A chill shot through me, and I could not help a frightened glance where we
      had been watching. But one of the horses began to graze and I had a
      wholesome thought. &ldquo;He's tired of whatever he sees, then,&rdquo; said I,
      pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile came for a moment in the Virginian's face. &ldquo;Must be a poor show,&rdquo;
       he observed. All the horses were grazing now, and he added, &ldquo;It ain't hurt
      their appetites any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We made our own breakfast then. And what uncanny dread I may have been
      touched with up to this time henceforth left me in the face of a real
      alarm. The shock of Steve was working upon the Virginian. He was aware of
      it himself; he was fighting it with all his might; and he was being
      overcome. He was indeed like a gallant swimmer against whom both wind and
      tide have conspired. And in this now foreboding solitude there was only
      myself to throw him ropes. His strokes for safety were as bold as was the
      undertow that ceaselessly annulled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I made a fuss in the tent?&rdquo; said he, feeling his way with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I threw him a rope. &ldquo;Yes. Nightmare&mdash;indigestion&mdash;too much
      newspaper before retiring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught the rope. &ldquo;That's correct! I had a hell of a foolish dream for a
      growed-up man. You'd not think it of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I should. I've had them after prolonged lobster and champagne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;prolonged! Prolonged is what does it.&rdquo; He glanced
      behind him. &ldquo;Steve came back&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your lobster dream,&rdquo; I put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he missed this rope. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, with his eyes searching me.
      &ldquo;And he handed me the paper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, where is that?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I built the fire with it. But when I took it from him it was a
      six-shooter I had hold of, and pointing at my breast. And then Steve
      spoke. 'Do you think you're fit to live?' Steve said; and I got hot at
      him, and I reckon I must have told him what I thought of him. You heard
      me, I expect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad I didn't. Your language sometimes is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed out. &ldquo;Oh, I account for all this that's happening just like you
      do. If we gave our explanations, they'd be pretty near twins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horses saw a bear, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe a bear. Maybe &ldquo;&mdash;but here the tide caught him again&mdash;&ldquo;What's
      your idea about dreams?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My ropes were all out. &ldquo;Liver&mdash;nerves,&rdquo; was the best I could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now he swam strongly by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may think I'm discreditable,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I know I am. It ought to
      take more than&mdash;well, men have lost their friendships before. Feuds
      and wars have cloven a right smart of bonds in twain. And if my haid is
      going to get shook by a little old piece of newspaper&mdash;I'm ashamed I
      burned that. I'm ashamed to have been that weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any man gets unstrung,&rdquo; I told him. My ropes had become straws; and I
      strove to frame some policy for the next hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now finished breakfast and set forth to catch the horses. As we drove
      them in I found that the Virginian was telling me a ghost story. &ldquo;At
      half-past three in the morning she saw her runaway daughter standing with
      a babe in her arms; but when she moved it was all gone. Later they found
      it was the very same hour the young mother died in Nogales. And she sent
      for the child and raised it herself. I knowed them both back home. Do you
      believe that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more do I believe it,&rdquo; he asserted. &ldquo;And see here! Nogales time is
      three hours different from Richmond. I didn't know about that point then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once out of these mountains, I knew he could right himself; but even I,
      who had no Steve to dream about, felt this silence of the peaks was
      preying on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her daughter and her might have been thinkin' mighty hard about each
      other just then,&rdquo; he pursued. &ldquo;But Steve is dead. Finished. You cert'nly
      don't believe there's anything more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm satisfied. Heaven didn't never interest me much. But if there was
      a world of dreams after you went&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped himself and turned his
      searching eyes away from mine. &ldquo;There's a heap o' darkness wherever you
      try to step,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I thought I'd left off wasting thoughts on the
      subject. You see&rdquo;&mdash;he dexterously roped a horse, and once more his
      splendid sanity was turned to gold by his imagination&mdash;&ldquo;I expect in
      many growed-up men you'd call sensible there's a little boy sleepin'&mdash;the
      little kid they onced was&mdash;that still keeps his fear of the dark. You
      mentioned the dark yourself yesterday. Well, this experience has woke up
      that kid in me, and blamed if I can coax the little cuss to go to sleep
      again! I keep a-telling him daylight will sure come, but he keeps a-crying
      and holding on to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere far in the basin there was a faint sound, and we stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was like our watching the dawn; nothing more followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have shot that bear,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer, and we put the saddles on without talk. We made no
      haste, but we were not over half an hour, I suppose, in getting off with
      the packs. It was not a new thing to hear a shot where wild game was in
      plenty; yet as we rode that shot sounded already in my mind different from
      others. Perhaps I should not believe this to-day but for what I look back
      to. To make camp last night we had turned off the trail, and now followed
      the stream down for a while, taking next a cut through the wood. In this
      way we came upon the tracks of our horses where they had been galloping
      back to the camp after their fright. They had kicked up the damp and
      matted pine needles very plainly all along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing has been here but themselves, though,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they ain't showing signs of remembering any scare,&rdquo; said the
      Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a little while we emerged upon an open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's where they was grazing,&rdquo; said the Virginian; and the signs were
      clear enough. &ldquo;Here's where they must have got their scare,&rdquo; he pursued.
      &ldquo;You stay with them while I circle a little.&rdquo; So I stayed; and certainly
      our animals were very calm at visiting this scene. When you bring a horse
      back to where he has recently encountered a wild animal his ears and his
      nostrils are apt to be wide awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian had stopped and was beckoning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's your bear,&rdquo; said he, as I arrived. &ldquo;Two-legged, you see. And he
      had a hawss of his own.&rdquo; There was a stake driven down where an animal had
      been picketed for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like Ounces,&rdquo; I said, considering the footprints.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Ounces. And Ounces wanted another hawss very bad, so him and Pounds
      could travel like gentlemen should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Pounds doesn't seem to have been with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Pounds, he was making coffee, somewheres in yonder, when this
      happened. Neither of them guessed there'd be other hawsses wandering here
      in the night, or they both would have come.&rdquo; He turned back to our pack
      animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll not hunt for this camp to make sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer making sure first. We might be expected at that camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took out his rifle from beneath his leg and set it across his saddle at
      half-cock. I did the same; and thus cautiously we resumed our journey in a
      slightly different direction. &ldquo;This ain't all we're going to find out,&rdquo;
       said the Virginian. &ldquo;Ounces had a good idea; but I reckon he made a bad
      mistake later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had found out a good deal without any more, I thought. Ounces had gone
      to bring in their single horse, and coming upon three more in the pasture
      had undertaken to catch one and failed, merely driving them where he
      feared to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shorty never could rope a horse alone,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian grinned. &ldquo;Shorty? Well, Shorty sounds as well as Ounces. But
      that ain't the mistake I'm thinking he made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew that he would not tell me, but that was just like him. For the last
      twenty minutes, having something to do, he had become himself again, had
      come to earth from that unsafe country of the brain where beckoned a
      spectral Steve. Nothing was left but in his eyes that question which pain
      had set there; and I wondered if his friend of old, who seemed so brave
      and amiable, would have dealt him that hurt at the solemn end had he known
      what a poisoned wound it would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came out on a ridge from which we could look down. &ldquo;You always want to
      ride on high places when there's folks around whose intentions ain't been
      declared,&rdquo; said the Virginian. And we went along our ridge for some
      distance. Then, suddenly he turned down and guided us almost at once to
      the trail. &ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;See.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The track of a horse was very fresh on the trail. But it was a galloping
      horse now, and no bootprints were keeping up with it any more. No boots
      could have kept up with it. The rider was making time to-day. Yesterday
      that horse had been ridden up into the mountains at leisure. Who was on
      him? There was never to be any certain answer to that. But who was not on
      him? We turned back in our journey, back into the heart of that basin with
      the tall peaks all rising like teeth in the cloudless sun, and the
      snow-fields shining white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was afraid of us,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;He did not know how many of us
      had come up here. Three hawsses might mean a dozen more around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We followed the backward trail in among the pines, and came after a time
      upon their camp. And then I understood the mistake that Shorty had made.
      He had returned after his failure, and had told that other man of the
      presence of new horses. He should have kept this a secret; for haste had
      to be made at once, and two cannot get away quickly upon one horse. But it
      was poor Shorty's last blunder. He lay there by their extinct fire, with
      his wistful, lost-dog face upward, and his thick yellow hair unparted as
      it had always been. The murder had been done from behind. We closed the
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no natural harm in him,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;But you must do a
      thing well in this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was not a trace, not a clew, of the other man; and we found a place
      where we could soon cover Shorty with earth. As we lifted him we saw the
      newspaper that he had been reading. He had brought it from the clump of
      cottonwoods where he and the other man had made a later visit than ours to
      be sure of the fate of their friends&mdash;or possibly in hopes of another
      horse. Evidently, when the party were surprised, they had been able to
      escape with only one. All of the newspaper was there save the leaf I had
      picked up&mdash;all and more, for this had pencil writing on it that was
      not mine, nor did I at first take it in. I thought it might be a clew, and
      I read it aloud. &ldquo;Good-by, Jeff,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;I could not have spoke to you
      without playing the baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's Jeff?&rdquo; I asked. But it came over me when I looked at the Virginian.
      He was standing beside me quite motionless; and then he put out his hand
      and took the paper, and stood still, looking at the words. &ldquo;Steve used to
      call me Jeff,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because I was Southern. I reckon nobody else ever
      did.&rdquo;

    <p>
      He slowly folded the message from the dead, brought by the dead, and
      rolled it in the coat behind his saddle. For a half-minute he stood
      leaning his forehead down against the saddle. After this he came back and
      contemplated Shorty's face awhile. &ldquo;I wish I could thank him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      wish I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We carried Shorty over and covered him with earth, and on that laid a few
      pine branches; then we took up our journey, and by the end of the forenoon
      we had gone some distance upon our trail through the Teton Mountains. But
      in front of us the hoofprints ever held their stride of haste, drawing
      farther from us through the hours, until by the next afternoon somewhere
      we noticed they were no longer to be seen; and after that they never came
      upon the trail again.

    <h2>
      XXXIII. THE SPINSTER LOSES SOME SLEEP
    </h2>
    <p>
      Somewhere at the eastern base of the Tetons did those hoofprints disappear
      into a mountain sanctuary where many crooked paths have led. He that took
      another man's possessions, or he that took another man's life, could
      always run here if the law or popular justice were too hot at his heels.
      Steep ranges and forests walled him in from the world on all four sides,
      almost without a break; and every entrance lay through intricate
      solitudes. Snake River came into the place through canyons and mournful
      pines and marshes, to the north, and went out at the south between
      formidable chasms. Every tributary to this stream rose among high peaks
      and ridges, and descended into the valley by well-nigh impenetrable
      courses: Pacific Creek from Two Ocean Pass, Buffalo Fork from no pass at
      all, Black Rock from the To-wo-ge-tee Pass&mdash;all these, and many more,
      were the waters of loneliness, among whose thousand hiding-places it was
      easy to be lost. Down in the bottom was a spread of level land, broad and
      beautiful, with the blue and silver Tetons rising from its chain of lakes
      to the west, and other heights presiding over its other sides. And up and
      down and in and out of this hollow square of mountains, where waters
      plentifully flowed, and game and natural pasture abounded, there skulked a
      nomadic and distrustful population. This in due time built cabins, took
      wives, begot children, and came to speak of itself as &ldquo;The honest settlers
      of Jackson's Hole.&rdquo; It is a commodious title, and doubtless to-day more
      accurate than it was once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this place the hoofprints disappeared. Not many cabins were yet built
      there; but the unknown rider of the horse knew well that he would find
      shelter and welcome among the felons of his stripe. Law and order might
      guess his name correctly, but there was no next step, for lack of
      evidence; and he would wait, whoever he was, until the rage of popular
      justice, which had been pursuing him and his brother thieves, should
      subside. Then, feeling his way gradually with prudence, he would let
      himself be seen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as mysteriously as he had melted away, rumor passed over the
      country. No tongue seemed to be heard telling the first news; the news was
      there, one day, a matter of whispered knowledge. On Sunk Creek and on Bear
      Creek, and elsewhere far and wide, before men talked men seemed secretly
      to know that Steve, and Ed, and Shorty, would never again be seen. Riders
      met each other in the road and drew rein to discuss the event, and its
      bearing upon the cattle interests. In town saloons men took each other
      aside, and muttered over it in corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it reached the ears of Molly Wood, beginning in a veiled and harmless
      shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      A neighbor joined her when she was out riding by herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Don't you find it lonesome?&rdquo; And when she
      answered lightly, he continued, meaning well: &ldquo;You'll be having company
      again soon now. He has finished his job. Wish he'd finished it MORE! Well,
      good day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly thought these words over. She could not tell why they gave her a
      strange feeling. To her Vermont mind no suspicion of the truth would come
      naturally. But suspicion began to come when she returned from her ride.
      For, entering the cabin of the Taylors', she came upon several people who
      all dropped their talk short, and were not skilful at resuming it. She sat
      there awhile, uneasily aware that all of them knew something which she did
      not know, and was not intended to know. A thought pierced her&mdash;had
      anything happened to her lover? No; that was not it. The man she had met
      on horseback spoke of her having company soon again. How soon? she
      wondered. He had been unable to say when he should return, and now she
      suddenly felt that a great silence had enveloped him lately: not the mere
      silence of absence, of receiving no messages or letters, but another sort
      of silence which now, at this moment, was weighing strangely upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the next day it came out at the schoolhouse. During that interval
      known as recess, she became aware through the open window that they were
      playing a new game outside. Lusty screeches of delight reached her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jump!&rdquo; a voice ordered. &ldquo;Jump!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to,&rdquo; returned another voice, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you would,&rdquo; said several. &ldquo;Didn't he say he would? Ah, he said
      he would. Jump now, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't want to,&rdquo; quavered the voice in a tone so dismal that Molly
      went out to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had got Bob Carmody on the top of the gate by a tree, with a rope
      round his neck, the other end of which four little boys were joyously
      holding. The rest looked on eagerly, three little girls clasping their
      hands, and springing up and down with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, children!&rdquo; exclaimed Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's said his prayers and everything,&rdquo; they all screamed out. &ldquo;He's a
      rustler, and we're lynchin' him. Jump, Bob!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, coward, won't take his medicine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him go, boys,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;You might really hurt him.&rdquo; And so she
      broke up this game, but not without general protest from Wyoming's young
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he would,&rdquo; Henry Dow assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And George Taylor further explained: &ldquo;He said he'd be Steve. But Steve
      didn't scare.&rdquo; Then George proceeded to tell the schoolmarm, eagerly, all
      about Steve and Ed, while the schoolmarm looked at him with a rigid face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised your mother you'd not tell,&rdquo; said Henry Dow, after all had
      been told. &ldquo;You've gone and done it,&rdquo; and Henry wagged his head in a
      superior manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did the New England girl learn what her cow-boy lover had done. She
      spoke of it to nobody; she kept her misery to herself. He was not there to
      defend his act. Perhaps in a way that was better. But these were hours of
      darkness indeed to Molly Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that visit to Dunbarton, when at the first sight of her lover's
      photograph in frontier dress her aunt had exclaimed, &ldquo;I suppose there are
      days when he does not kill people,&rdquo; she had cried in all good faith and
      mirth, &ldquo;He never killed anybody!&rdquo; Later, when he was lying in her cabin
      weak from his bullet wound, but each day stronger beneath her nursing, at
      a certain word of his there had gone through her a shudder of doubt.
      Perhaps in his many wanderings he had done such a thing in self-defence,
      or in the cause of popular justice. But she had pushed the idea away from
      her hastily, back into the days before she had ever seen him. If this had
      ever happened, let her not know of it. Then, as a cruel reward for his
      candor and his laying himself bare to her mother, the letters from
      Bennington had used that very letter of his as a weapon against him. Her
      sister Sarah had quoted from it. &ldquo;He says with apparent pride,&rdquo; wrote
      Sarah, &ldquo;that he has never killed for pleasure or profit.' Those are his
      exact words, and you may guess their dreadful effect upon mother. I
      congratulate you, my dear, on having chosen a protector so scrupulous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus her elder sister had seen fit to write; and letters from less near
      relatives made hints at the same subject. So she was compelled to accept
      this piece of knowledge thrust upon her. Yet still, still, those events
      had been before she knew him. They were remote, without detail or context.
      He had been little more than a boy. No doubt it was to save his own life.
      And so she bore the hurt of her discovery all the more easily because her
      sister's tone roused her to defend her cow-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now!
    </p>
    <p>
      In her cabin, alone, after midnight, she arose from her sleepless bed, and
      lighting the candle, stood before his photograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a good face,&rdquo; her great-aunt had said, after some study of it. And
      these words were in her mind now. There his likeness stood at full length,
      confronting her: the spurs on the boots, the fringed leathern chaparreros,
      the coiled rope in hand, the pistol at hip, the rough flannel shirt, and
      the scarf knotted at the throat&mdash;and then the grave eyes, looking at
      her. It thrilled her to meet them, even so. She could read life into them.
      She seemed to feel passion come from them, and then something like
      reproach. She stood for a long while looking at him, and then, beating her
      hands together suddenly, she blew out her light and went back into bed,
      but not to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're looking pale, deary,&rdquo; said Mrs. Taylor to her, a few days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don't eat anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I do.&rdquo; And Molly retired to her cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George,&rdquo; said Mrs. Taylor, &ldquo;you come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may seem severe&mdash;I think that it was severe. That evening when Mr.
      Taylor came home to his family, George received a thrashing for
      disobedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose,&rdquo; said Mrs. Taylor to her husband, &ldquo;that she came out just
      in time to stop 'em breaking Bob Carmody's neck for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon the day following Mrs. Taylor essayed the impossible. She took
      herself over to Molly Wood's cabin. The girl gave her a listless greeting,
      and the dame sat slowly down, and surveyed the comfortable room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very nice home, deary,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if it was a home. But you'll fix
      something like this in your real home, I have no doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we're going to do without you I can't see,&rdquo; said Mrs. Taylor. &ldquo;But
      I'd not have it different for worlds. He'll be coming back soon, I
      expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Taylor,&rdquo; said Molly, all at once, &ldquo;please don't say anything now. I
      can't stand it.&rdquo; And she broke into wretched tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, deary, he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not a word. Please, please&mdash;I'll go out if you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The older woman went to the younger one, and then put her arms round her.
      But when the tears were over, they had not done any good; it was not the
      storm that clears the sky&mdash;all storms do not clear the sky. And Mrs.
      Taylor looked at the pale girl and saw that she could do nothing to help
      her toward peace of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said to her husband, after returning from her profitless
      errand, &ldquo;you might know she'd feel dreadful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo; said Taylor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know just as well as I do. And I'll say for myself, I hope
      you'll never have to help hang folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Taylor, mildly, &ldquo;if I had to, I'd have to, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't want it to come. But that poor girl is eating her heart
      right out over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's what she don't say. She'll not talk, and she'll not let me talk, and
      she sits and sits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go talk some to her,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Taylor, I thought you had more sense. You'd not get a word in.
      She'll be sick soon if her worry ain't stopped someway, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she want this country to do?&rdquo; inquired Taylor. &ldquo;Does she expect
      it to be like Vermont when it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't help what she expects,&rdquo; his wife interrupted. &ldquo;But I wish we
      could help HER.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They could not, however; and help came from another source. Judge Henry
      rode by the next day. To him good Mrs. Taylor at once confided her
      anxiety. The Judge looked grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I meddle?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Judge, you must,&rdquo; said Mrs. Taylor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why can't I send him over here when he gets back? Then they'll just
      settle it between themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Taylor shook her head. &ldquo;That would unsettle it worse than it is,&rdquo; she
      assured him. &ldquo;They mustn't meet just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge sighed. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;very well. I'll sacrifice my
      character, since you insist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Henry sat thinking, waiting until school should be out. He did not
      at all relish what lay before him. He would like to have got out of it. He
      had been a federal judge; he had been an upright judge; he had met the
      responsibilities of his difficult office not only with learning, which is
      desirable, but also with courage and common sense besides, and these are
      essential. He had been a stanch servant of the law. And now he was invited
      to defend that which, at first sight, nay, even at second and third sight,
      must always seem a defiance of the law more injurious than crime itself.
      Every good man in this world has convictions about right and wrong. They
      are his soul's riches, his spiritual gold. When his conduct is at variance
      with these, he knows that it is a departure, a falling; and this is a
      simple and clear matter. If falling were all that ever happened to a good
      man, all his days would be a simple matter of striving and repentance. But
      it is not all. There come to him certain junctures, crises, when life,
      like a highwayman, springs upon him, demanding that he stand and deliver
      his convictions in the name of some righteous cause, bidding him do evil
      that good may come. I cannot say that I believe in doing evil that good
      may come. I do not. I think that any man who honestly justifies such
      course deceives himself. But this I can say: to call any act evil,
      instantly begs the question. Many an act that man does is right or wrong
      according to the time and place which form, so to speak, its context;
      strip it of its surrounding circumstances, and you tear away its meaning.
      Gentlemen reformers, beware of this common practice of yours! beware of
      calling an act evil on Tuesday because that same act was evil on Monday!
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you fail to follow my meaning? Then here is an illustration. On Monday
      I walk over my neighbor's field; there is no wrong in such walking. By
      Tuesday he has put up a sign that trespassers will be prosecuted according
      to law. I walk again on Tuesday, and am a law-breaker. Do you begin to see
      my point? or are you inclined to object to the illustration because the
      walking on Tuesday was not WRONG, but merely ILLEGAL? Then here is another
      illustration which you will find it a trifle more embarrassing to answer.
      Consider carefully, let me beg you, the case of a young man and a young
      woman who walk out of a door on Tuesday, pronounced man and wife by a
      third party inside the door. It matters not that on Monday they were, in
      their own hearts, sacredly vowed to each other. If they had omitted
      stepping inside that door, if they had dispensed with that third party,
      and gone away on Monday sacredly vowed to each other in their own hearts,
      you would have scarcely found their conduct moral. Consider these things
      carefully,&mdash;the sign-post and the third party,&mdash;and the
      difference they make. And now, for a finish, we will return to the
      sign-post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose that I went over my neighbor's field on Tuesday, after the
      sign-post was put up, because I saw a murder about to be committed in the
      field, and therefore ran in and stopped it. Was I doing evil that good
      might come? Do you not think that to stay out and let the murder be done
      would have been the evil act in this case? To disobey the sign-post was
      RIGHT; and I trust that you now perceive the same act may wear as many
      different hues of right or wrong as the rainbow, according to the
      atmosphere in which it is done. It is not safe to say of any man, &ldquo;He did
      evil that good might come.&rdquo; Was the thing that he did, in the first place,
      evil? That is the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgive my asking you to use your mind. It is a thing which no novelist
      should expect of his reader, and we will go back at once to Judge Henry
      and his meditations about lynching.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was well aware that if he was to touch at all upon this subject with
      the New England girl, he could not put her off with mere platitudes and
      humdrum formulas; not, at least, if he expected to do any good. She was
      far too intelligent, and he was really anxious to do good. For her sake he
      wanted the course of the girl's true love to run more smoothly, and still
      more did he desire this for the sake of his Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent him myself on that business,&rdquo; the Judge reflected uncomfortably.
      &ldquo;I am partly responsible for the lynching. It has brought him one great
      unhappiness already through the death of Steve. If it gets running in this
      girl's mind, she may&mdash;dear me!&rdquo; the Judge broke off, &ldquo;what a
      nuisance!&rdquo; And he sighed. For as all men know, he also knew that many
      things should be done in this world in silence, and that talking about
      them is a mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when school was out, and the girl gone to her cabin, his mind had set
      the subject in order thoroughly, and he knocked at her door, ready, as he
      had put it, to sacrifice his character in the cause of true love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, coming straight to the point, &ldquo;some dark things have
      happened.&rdquo; And when she made no answer to this, he continued: &ldquo;But you
      must not misunderstand us. We're too fond of you for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Henry,&rdquo; said Molly Wood, also coming straight to the point, &ldquo;have
      you come to tell me that you think well of lynching?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He met her. &ldquo;Of burning Southern negroes in public, no. Of hanging Wyoming
      cattle thieves in private, yes. You perceive there's a difference, don't
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in principle,&rdquo; said the girl, dry and short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;dear&mdash;me!&rdquo; slowly exclaimed the Judge. &ldquo;I am sorry that you
      cannot see that, because I think that I can. And I think that you have
      just as much sense as I have.&rdquo; The Judge made himself very grave and very
      good-humored at the same time. The poor girl was strung to a high pitch,
      and spoke harshly in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the difference in principle?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Judge, easy and thoughtful, &ldquo;what do you mean by
      principle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't think you'd quibble,&rdquo; flashed Molly. &ldquo;I'm not a lawyer myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man less wise than Judge Henry would have smiled at this, and then war
      would have exploded hopelessly between them, and harm been added to what
      was going wrong already. But the Judge knew that he must give to every
      word that the girl said now his perfect consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean to quibble,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;I know the trick of escaping
      from one question by asking another. But I don't want to escape from
      anything you hold me to answer. If you can show me that I am wrong, I want
      you to do so. But,&rdquo; and here the Judge smiled, &ldquo;I want you to play fair,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how am I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to be just as willing to be put right by me as I am to be put
      right by you. And so when you use such a word as principle, you must help
      me to answer by saying what principle you mean. For in all sincerity I see
      no likeness in principle whatever between burning Southern negroes in
      public and hanging Wyoming horse-thieves in private. I consider the
      burning a proof that the South is semi-barbarous, and the hanging a proof
      that Wyoming is determined to become civilized. We do not torture our
      criminals when we lynch them. We do not invite spectators to enjoy their
      death agony. We put no such hideous disgrace upon the United States. We
      execute our criminals by the swiftest means, and in the quietest way. Do
      you think the principle is the same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly had listened to him with attention. &ldquo;The way is different,&rdquo; she
      admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it seems to me. Both defy law and order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but do they both? Now we're getting near the principle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. Ordinary citizens take the law in their own hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The principle at last!&rdquo; exclaimed the Judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me some more things. Out of whose hands do they take the law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The court's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made the courts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did there come to be any courts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Constitution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did there come to be any Constitution? Who made it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The delegates, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who made the delegates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they were elected, or appointed, or something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who elected them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course the people elected them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call them the ordinary citizens,&rdquo; said the Judge. &ldquo;I like your term. They
      are where the law comes from, you see. For they chose the delegates who
      made the Constitution that provided for the courts. There's your
      machinery. These are the hands into which ordinary citizens have put the
      law. So you see, at best, when they lynch they only take back what they
      once gave. Now we'll take your two cases that you say are the same in
      principle. I think that they are not. For in the South they take a negro
      from jail where he was waiting to be duly hung. The South has never
      claimed that the law would let him go. But in Wyoming the law has been
      letting our cattle-thieves go for two years. We are in a very bad way, and
      we are trying to make that way a little better until civilization can
      reach us. At present we lie beyond its pale. The courts, or rather the
      juries, into whose hands we have put the law, are not dealing the law.
      They are withered hands, or rather they are imitation hands made for show,
      with no life in them, no grip. They cannot hold a cattle-thief. And so
      when your ordinary citizen sees this, and sees that he has placed justice
      in a dead hand, he must take justice back into his own hands where it was
      once at the beginning of all things. Call this primitive, if you will. But
      so far from being a DEFIANCE of the law, it is an ASSERTION of it&mdash;the
      fundamental assertion of self governing men, upon whom our whole social
      fabric is based. There is your principle, Miss Wood, as I see it. Now can
      you help me to see anything different?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But perhaps you are of the same opinion still?&rdquo; the Judge inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all terrible to me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and so is capital punishment terrible. And so is war. And perhaps
      some day we shall do without them. But they are none of them so terrible
      as unchecked theft and murder would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the Judge had departed on his way to Sunk Creek, no one spoke to
      Molly upon this subject. But her face did not grow cheerful at once. It
      was plain from her fits of silence that her thoughts were not at rest. And
      sometimes at night she would stand in front of her lover's likeness,
      gazing upon it with both love and shrinking.

    <h2>
      XXXIV. TO FIT HER FINGER
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was two rings that the Virginian wrote for when next I heard from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After my dark sight of what the Cattle Land could be, I soon had journeyed
      home by way of Washakie and Rawlins. Steve and Shorty did not leave my
      memory, nor will they ever, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian had touched the whole thing the day I left him. He had
      noticed me looking a sort of farewell at the plains and mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come back to it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If there was a headstone for every
      man that once pleasured in his freedom here, yu'd see one most every time
      yu' turned your head. It's a heap sadder than a graveyard&mdash;but yu'
      love it all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sadness had passed from him&mdash;from his uppermost mood, at least, when
      he wrote about the rings. Deep in him was sadness of course, as well as
      joy. For he had known Steve, and he had covered Shorty with earth. He had
      looked upon life with a marksman's eyes, very close; and no one, if he
      have a heart, can pass through this and not carry sadness in his spirit
      with him forever. But he seldom shows it openly; it bides within him,
      enriching his cheerfulness and rendering him of better service to his
      fellow-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a commission of cheerfulness that he now gave, being distant from
      where rings are to be bought. He could not go so far as the East to
      procure what he had planned. Rings were to be had in Cheyenne, and a still
      greater choice in Denver; and so far as either of these towns his affairs
      would have permitted him to travel. But he was set upon having rings from
      the East. They must come from the best place in the country; nothing short
      of that was good enough &ldquo;to fit her finger,&rdquo; as he said. The wedding ring
      was a simple matter. Let it be right, that was all: the purest gold that
      could be used, with her initials and his together graven round the inside,
      with the day of the month and the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The date was now set. It had come so far as this. July third was to be the
      day. Then for sixty days and nights he was to be a bridegroom, free from
      his duties at Sunk Creek, free to take his bride wheresoever she might
      choose to go. And she had chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those voices of the world had more than angered her; for after the anger a
      set purpose was left. Her sister should have the chance neither to come
      nor to stay away. Had her mother even answered the Virginian's letter,
      there could have been some relenting. But the poor lady had been
      inadequate in this, as in all other searching moments of her life: she had
      sent messages,&mdash;kind ones, to be sure,&mdash;but only messages. If
      this had hurt the Virginian, no one knew it in the world, least of all the
      girl in whose heart it had left a cold, frozen spot. Not a good spirit in
      which to be married, you will say. No; frozen spots are not good at any
      time. But Molly's own nature gave her due punishment. Through all these
      days of her warm happiness a chill current ran, like those which interrupt
      the swimmer's perfect joy. The girl was only half as happy as her lover;
      but she hid this deep from him,&mdash;hid it until that final, fierce hour
      of reckoning that her nature had with her,&mdash;nay, was bound to have
      with her, before the punishment was lifted, and the frozen spot melted at
      length from her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, meanwhile, she made her decree against Bennington. Not Vermont, but
      Wyoming, should be her wedding place. No world's voices should be
      whispering, no world's eyes should be looking on, when she made her vow to
      him and received his vow. Those voices should be spoken and that ring put
      on in this wild Cattle Land, where first she had seen him ride into the
      flooded river, and lift her ashore upon his horse. It was this open sky
      which should shine down on them, and this frontier soil upon which their
      feet should tread. The world should take its turn second.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a month with him by stream and canyon, a month far deeper into the
      mountain wilds than ever yet he had been free to take her, a month with
      sometimes a tent and sometimes the stars above them, and only their horses
      besides themselves&mdash;after such a month as this, she would take him to
      her mother and to Bennington; and the old aunt over at Dunbarton would
      look at him, and be once more able to declare that the Starks had always
      preferred a man who was a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so July third was to be engraved inside the wedding ring. Upon the
      other ring the Virginian had spent much delicious meditation, all in his
      secret mind. He had even got the right measure of her finger without her
      suspecting the reason. But this step was the final one in his plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the time that his thoughts had begun to be busy over the other
      ring, by a chance he had learned from Mrs. Henry a number of old fancies
      regarding precious stones. Mrs. Henry often accompanied the Judge in
      venturesome mountain climbs, and sometimes the steepness of the rocks
      required her to use her hands for safety. One day when the Virginian went
      with them to help mark out certain boundary corners, she removed her rings
      lest they should get scratched; and he, being just behind her, took them
      during the climb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you're looking at my topaz,&rdquo; she had said, as he returned them. &ldquo;If
      I could have chosen, it would have been a ruby. But I was born in
      November.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not understand her in the least, but her words awakened exceeding
      interest in him; and they had descended some five miles of mountain before
      he spoke again. Then he became ingenious, for he had half worked out what
      Mrs. Henry's meaning must be; but he must make quite sure. Therefore,
      according to his wild, shy nature, he became ingenious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men wear rings,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Some of the men on the ranch do. I don't see
      any harm in a man's wearin' a ring. But I never have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the lady, not yet suspecting that he was undertaking to
      circumvent her, &ldquo;probably those men have sweethearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am. Not sweethearts worth wearin' rings for&mdash;in two cases,
      anyway. They won 'em at cyards. And they like to see 'em shine. I never
      saw a man wear a topaz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Henry did not have any further remark to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was born in January myself,&rdquo; pursued the Virginian, very thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the lady gave him one look, and without further process of mind
      perceived exactly what he was driving at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's very extravagant for rings,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;January is diamonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diamonds,&rdquo; murmured the Virginian, more and more thoughtfully. &ldquo;Well, it
      don't matter, for I'd not wear a ring. And November is&mdash;what did yu'
      say, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Topaz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Well, jewels are cert'nly pretty things. In the Spanish Missions
      yu'll see large ones now and again. And they're not glass, I think. And so
      they have got some jewel that kind of belongs to each month right around
      the twelve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Henry, smiling. &ldquo;One for each month. But the opal is what
      you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, and began to blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;October is the opal,&rdquo; she added, and she laughed outright, for Miss
      Wood's birthday was on the fifteenth of that month.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian smiled guiltily at her through his crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've no doubt you can beat around the bush very well with men,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Henry. &ldquo;But it's perfectly transparent with us&mdash;in matters of
      sentiment, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am sorry,&rdquo; he presently said. &ldquo;I don't want to give her an opal.
      I have no superstition, but I don't want to give her an opal. If her
      mother did, or anybody like that, why, all right. But not from me. D' yu'
      understand, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Henry did understand this subtle trait in the wild man, and she
      rejoiced to be able to give him immediate reassurance concerning opals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry about that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The opal is said to bring ill luck,
      but not when it is your own month stone. Then it is supposed to be not
      only deprived of evil influence, but to possess peculiarly fortunate
      power. Let it be an opal ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he asked her boldly various questions, and she showed him her rings,
      and gave him advice about the setting. There was no special custom, she
      told him, ruling such rings as this he desired to bestow. The gem might be
      the lady's favorite or the lover's favorite; and to choose the lady's
      month stone was very well indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very well indeed, the Virginian thought. But not quite well enough for
      him. His mind now busied itself with this lore concerning jewels, and soon
      his sentiment had suggested something which he forthwith carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ring was achieved, it was an opal, but set with four small
      embracing diamonds. Thus was her month stone joined with his, that their
      luck and their love might be inseparably clasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the size of her finger one day when winter had departed, and the
      early grass was green. He made a ring of twisted grass for her, while she
      held her hand for him to bind it. He made another for himself. Then, after
      each had worn their grass ring for a while, he begged her to exchange. He
      did not send his token away from him, but most carefully measured it. Thus
      the ring fitted her well, and the lustrous flame within the opal thrilled
      his heart each time he saw it. For now June was near its end; and that
      other plain gold ring, which, for safe keeping, he cherished suspended
      round his neck day and night, seemed to burn with an inward glow that was
      deeper than the opal's.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in due course arrived the second of July. Molly's punishment had got as
      far as this: she longed for her mother to be near her at this time; but it
      was too late.

    <h2>
      XXXV. WITH MALICE AFORETHOUGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Town lay twelve straight miles before the lover and his sweetheart, when
      they came to the brow of the last long hill. All beneath them was like a
      map: neither man nor beast distinguishable, but the veined and tinted
      image of a country, knobs and flats set out in order clearly, shining
      extensive and motionless in the sun. It opened on the sight of the lovers
      as they reached the sudden edge of the tableland, where since morning they
      had ridden with the head of neither horse ever in advance of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the view of their journey's end, the Virginian looked down at his girl
      beside him, his eyes filled with a bridegroom's light, and, hanging safe
      upon his breast, he could feel the gold ring that he would slowly press
      upon her finger to-morrow. He drew off the glove from her left hand, and
      stooping, kissed the jewel in that other ring which he had given her. The
      crimson fire in the opal seemed to mingle with that in his heart, and his
      arm lifted her during a moment from the saddle as he held her to him. But
      in her heart the love of him was troubled by that cold pang of loneliness
      which had crept upon her like a tide as the day drew near. None of her own
      people were waiting in that distant town to see her become his bride.
      Friendly faces she might pass on the way; but all of them new friends,
      made in this wild country: not a face of her childhood would smile upon
      her; and deep within her, a voice cried for the mother who was far away in
      Vermont. That she would see Mrs. Taylor's kind face at her wedding was no
      comfort now.
    </p>
    <p>
      There lay the town in the splendor of Wyoming space. Around it spread the
      watered fields, westward for a little way, eastward to a great distance,
      making squares of green and yellow crops; and the town was but a poor rag
      in the midst of this quilted harvest. After the fields to the east, the
      tawny plain began; and with one faint furrow of river lining its
      undulations, it stretched beyond sight. But west of the town rose the Bow
      Leg Mountains, cool with their still unmelted snows and their dull blue
      gulfs of pine. From three canyons flowed three clear forks which began the
      river. Their confluence was above the town a good two miles; it looked but
      a few paces from up here, while each side the river straggled the margin
      cottonwoods, like thin borders along a garden walk. Over all this map hung
      silence like a harmony, tremendous yet serene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful! how I love it!&rdquo; whispered the girl. &ldquo;But, oh, how big it
      is!&rdquo; And she leaned against her lover for an instant. It was her spirit
      seeking shelter. To-day, this vast beauty, this primal calm, had in it for
      her something almost of dread. The small, comfortable, green hills of home
      rose before her. She closed her eyes and saw Vermont: a village street,
      and the post-office, and ivy covering an old front door, and her mother
      picking some yellow roses from a bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a sound, her eyes quickly opened; and here was her lover turned in his
      saddle, watching another horseman approach. She saw the Virginian's hand
      in a certain position, and knew that his pistol was ready. But the other
      merely overtook and passed them, as they stood at the brow of the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man had given one nod to the Virginian, and the Virginian one to him;
      and now he was already below them on the descending road. To Molly Wood he
      was a stranger; but she had seen his eyes when he nodded to her lover, and
      she knew, even without the pistol, that this was not enmity at first
      sight. It was not indeed. Five years of gathered hate had looked out of
      the man's eyes. And she asked her lover who this was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, easily, &ldquo;just a man I see now and then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is his name Trampas?&rdquo; said Molly Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian looked at her in surprise. &ldquo;Why, where have you seen him?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never till now. But I knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gracious! Yu' never told me yu' had mind-reading powers.&rdquo; And he
      smiled serenely at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it was Trampas as soon as I saw his eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gracious!&rdquo; her lover repeated with indulgent irony. &ldquo;I must be mighty
      careful of my eyes when you're lookin' at 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he did that murder,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose mind are yu' readin' now?&rdquo; he drawled affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could not joke her off the subject. She took his strong hand in
      hers, tremulously, so much of it as her little hand could hold. &ldquo;I know
      something about that&mdash;that&mdash;last autumn,&rdquo; she said, shrinking
      from words more definite. &ldquo;And I know that you only did&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I had to,&rdquo; he finished, very sadly, but sternly, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she asserted, keeping hold of his hand. &ldquo;I suppose that&mdash;lynching&mdash;&rdquo;
       (she almost whispered the word) &ldquo;is the only way. But when they had to die
      just for stealing horses, it seems so wicked that this murderer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can prove it?&rdquo; asked the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know a heap o' things inside my heart. But that's not proving. There
      was only the body, and the hoofprints&mdash;and what folks guessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was never even arrested!&rdquo; the girl said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He helped elect the sheriff in that county.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Molly ventured a step inside the border of her lover's reticence. &ldquo;I
      saw&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated, &ldquo;just now, I saw what you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned to his caressing irony. &ldquo;You'll have me plumb scared if you
      keep on seein' things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had your pistol ready for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I believe I did. It was mighty unnecessary.&rdquo; And the Virginian took
      out the pistol again, and shook his head over it, like one who has been
      caught in a blunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, and knew that she must step outside his reticence
      again. By love and her surrender to him their positions had been
      exchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not now, as through his long courting he had been, her
      half-obeying, half-refractory worshipper. She was no longer his
      half-indulgent, half-scornful superior. Her better birth and schooling
      that had once been weapons to keep him at his distance, or bring her off
      victorious in their encounters, had given way before the onset of the
      natural man himself. She knew her cow-boy lover, with all that he lacked,
      to be more than ever she could be, with all that she had. He was her
      worshipper still, but her master, too. Therefore now, against the baffling
      smile he gave her, she felt powerless. And once again a pang of yearning
      for her mother to be near her to-day shot through the girl. She looked
      from her untamed man to the untamed desert of Wyoming, and the town where
      she was to take him as her wedded husband. But for his sake she would not
      let him guess her loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat on his horse Monte, considering the pistol. Then he showed her a
      rattlesnake coiled by the roots of some sage-brush. &ldquo;Can I hit it?&rdquo; he
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't often miss them,&rdquo; said she, striving to be cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm told getting married unstrings some men.&rdquo; He aimed, and the
      snake was shattered. &ldquo;Maybe it's too early yet for the unstringing to
      begin!&rdquo; And with some deliberation he sent three more bullets into the
      snake. &ldquo;I reckon that's enough,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was not the first one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, for the snake.&rdquo; And then, with one leg crooked cow-boy fashion
      across in front of his saddle-horn, he cleaned his pistol, and replaced
      the empty cartridges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more she ventured near the line of his reticence. &ldquo;Has&mdash;has
      Trampas seen you much lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no; not for a right smart while. But I reckon he has not missed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian spoke this in his gentlest voice. But his rebuffed
      sweetheart turned her face away, and from her eyes she brushed a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reined his horse Monte beside her, and upon her cheek she felt his
      kiss. &ldquo;You are not the only mind-reader,&rdquo; said he, very tenderly. And at
      this she clung to him, and laid her head upon his breast. &ldquo;I had been
      thinking,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that the way our marriage is to be was the most
      beautiful way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the most beautiful,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slowly spoke out his thought, as if she had not said this. &ldquo;No folks to
      stare, no fuss, no jokes and ribbons and best bonnets, no public eye nor
      talkin' of tongues when most yu' want to hear nothing and say nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered by holding him closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the bishop of Wyoming to join us, and not even him after we're once
      joined. I did think that would be ahead of all ways to get married I have
      seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused again, and she made no rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have left out your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked in his face with quick astonishment. It was as if his spirit
      had heard the cry of her spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nowhere near right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She could never have come here,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should have gone there. I don't know how I can ask her to forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was not you!&rdquo; cried Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Because I did not object. I did not tell you we must go to her. I
      missed the point, thinking so much about my own feelings. For you see&mdash;and
      I've never said this to you until now&mdash;your mother did hurt me. When
      you said you would have me after my years of waiting, and I wrote her that
      letter telling her all about myself, and how my family was not like yours,
      and&mdash;and&mdash;all the rest I told her, why you see it hurt me never
      to get a word back from her except just messages through you. For I had
      talked to her about my hopes and my failings. I had said more than ever
      I've said to you, because she was your mother. I wanted her to forgive me,
      if she could, and feel that maybe I could take good care of you after all.
      For it was bad enough to have her daughter quit her home to teach school
      out hyeh on Bear Creek. Bad enough without havin' me to come along and
      make it worse. I have missed the point in thinking of my own feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's not your doing!&rdquo; repeated Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his deep delicacy he had put the whole matter as a hardship to her
      mother alone. He had saved her any pain of confession or denial. &ldquo;Yes, it
      is my doing,&rdquo; he now said. &ldquo;Shall we give it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give what&mdash;?&rdquo; She did not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the order we've got it fixed in. Plans are&mdash;well, they're no
      more than plans. I hate the notion of changing, but I hate hurting your
      mother more. Or, anyway, I OUGHT to hate it more. So we can shift, if yu'
      say so. It's not too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shift?&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, we can go to your home now. We can start by the stage to-night.
      Your mother can see us married. We can come back and finish in the
      mountains instead of beginning in them. It'll be just merely shifting, yu'
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could scarcely bring himself to say this at all; yet he said it almost
      as if he were urging it. It implied a renunciation that he could hardly
      bear to think of. To put off his wedding day, the bliss upon whose
      threshold he stood after his three years of faithful battle for it, and
      that wedding journey he had arranged: for there were the mountains in
      sight, the woods and canyons where he had planned to go with her after the
      bishop had joined them; the solitudes where only the wild animals would
      be, besides themselves. His horses, his tent, his rifle, his rod, all were
      waiting ready in the town for their start to-morrow. He had provided many
      dainty things to make her comfortable. Well, he could wait a little more,
      having waited three years. It would not be what his heart most desired:
      there would be the &ldquo;public eye and the talking of tongues&rdquo;&mdash;but he
      could wait. The hour would come when he could be alone with his bride at
      last. And so he spoke as if he urged it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Never, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pushed it from her. She would not brook such sacrifice on his part.
      Were they not going to her mother in four weeks? If her family had warmly
      accepted him&mdash;but they had not; and in any case, it had gone too far,
      it was too late. She told her lover that she would not hear him, that if
      he said any more she would gallop into town separately from him. And for
      his sake she would hide deep from him this loneliness of hers, and the
      hurt that he had given her in refusing to share with her his trouble with
      Trampas, when others must know of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, they descended the hill slowly together, lingering to spin
      out these last miles long. Many rides had taught their horses to go side
      by side, and so they went now: the girl sweet and thoughtful in her sedate
      gray habit; and the man in his leathern chaps and cartridge belt and
      flannel shirt, looking gravely into the distance with the level gaze of
      the frontier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having read his sweetheart's mind very plainly, the lover now broke his
      dearest custom. It was his code never to speak ill of any man to any
      woman. Men's quarrels were not for women's ears. In his scheme, good women
      were to know only a fragment of men's lives. He had lived many outlaw
      years, and his wide knowledge of evil made innocence doubly precious to
      him. But to-day he must depart from his code, having read her mind well.
      He would speak evil of one man to one woman, because his reticence had
      hurt her&mdash;and was she not far from her mother, and very lonely, do
      what he could? She should know the story of his quarrel in language as
      light and casual as he could veil it with.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made an oblique start. He did not say to her: &ldquo;I'll tell you about
      this. You saw me get ready for Trampas because I have been ready for him
      any time these five years.&rdquo; He began far off from the point with that
      rooted caution of his&mdash;that caution which is shared by the primal
      savage and the perfected diplomat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's cert'nly a right smart o' difference between men and women,&rdquo; he
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're quite sure?&rdquo; she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't it fortunate?&mdash;that there's both, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about fortunate. Machinery could probably do all the heavy
      work for us without your help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who'd invent the machinery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. &ldquo;We shouldn't need the huge, noisy things you do. Our world
      would be a gentle one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my gracious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my gracious! Get along, Monte! A gentle world all full of ladies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call men gentle?&rdquo; inquired Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it's a funny thing about that. Have yu' ever noticed a joke about
      fathers-in-law? There's just as many fathers&mdash;as mothers-in-law; but
      which side are your jokes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly was not vanquished. &ldquo;That's because the men write the comic papers,&rdquo;
       said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear that, Monte? The men write 'em. Well, if the ladies wrote a comic
      paper, I expect that might be gentle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave up this battle in mirth; and he resumed:&mdash; &ldquo;But don't you
      really reckon it's uncommon to meet a father-in-law flouncin' around the
      house? As for gentle&mdash;Once I had to sleep in a room next a ladies'
      temperance meetin'. Oh, heavens! Well, I couldn't change my room, and the
      hotel man, he apologized to me next mawnin'. Said it didn't surprise him
      the husbands drank some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the Virginian broke down over his own fantastic inventions, and gave
      a joyous chuckle in company with his sweetheart. &ldquo;Yes, there's a big heap
      o' difference between men and women,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Take that fello' and
      myself, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trampas?&rdquo; said Molly, quickly serious. She looked along the road ahead,
      and discerned the figure of Trampas still visible on its way to town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian did not wish her to be serious&mdash;more than could be
      helped. &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he replied, with a waving gesture at Trampas. &ldquo;Take
      him and me. He don't think much o' me! How could he? And I expect he'll
      never. But yu' saw just now how it was between us. We were not a bit like
      a temperance meetin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not help laughing at the twist he gave to his voice. And she
      felt happiness warming her; for in the Virginian's tone about Trampas was
      something now that no longer excluded her. Thus he began his gradual
      recital, in a cadence always easy, and more and more musical with the
      native accent of the South. With the light turn he gave it, its pure
      ugliness melted into charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he don't think anything of me. Once a man in the John Day Valley
      didn't think much, and by Caada de Oro I met another. It will always be
      so here and there, but Trampas beats 'em all. For the others have always
      expressed themselves&mdash;got shut of their poor opinion in the open
      air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yu' see, I had to explain myself to Trampas a right smart while ago, long
      before ever I laid my eyes on yu'. It was just nothing at all. A little
      matter of cyards in the days when I was apt to spend my money and my
      holidays pretty headlong. My gracious, what nonsensical times I have had!
      But I was apt to win at cyards, 'specially poker. And Trampas, he met me
      one night, and I expect he must have thought I looked kind o' young. So he
      hated losin' his money to such a young-lookin' man, and he took his way of
      sayin' as much. I had to explain myself to him plainly, so that he learned
      right away my age had got its growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I expect he hated that worse, having to receive my explanation with
      folks lookin' on at us publicly that-a-way, and him without further ideas
      occurrin' to him at the moment. That's what started his poor opinion of
      me, not havin' ideas at the moment. And so the boys resumed their cyards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd most forgot about it. But Trampas's mem'ry is one of his strong
      points. Next thing&mdash;oh, it's a good while later&mdash;he gets to
      losin' flesh because Judge Henry gave me charge of him and some other
      punchers taking cattle&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not next,&rdquo; interrupted the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not? Why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you remember?&rdquo; she said, timid, yet eager. &ldquo;Don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blamed if I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first time we met?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; my mem'ry keeps that&mdash;like I keep this.&rdquo; And he brought from
      his pocket her own handkerchief, the token he had picked up at a river's
      brink when he had carried her from an overturned stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did not exactly meet, then,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was at that dance. I hadn't
      seen you yet; but Trampas was saying something horrid about me, and you
      said&mdash;you said, 'Rise on your legs, you pole cat, and tell them
      you're a liar.' When I heard that, I think&mdash;I think it finished me.&rdquo;
       And crimson suffused Molly's countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd forgot,&rdquo; the Virginian murmured. Then sharply, &ldquo;How did you hear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Taylor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Well, a man would never have told a woman that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly laughed triumphantly. &ldquo;Then who told Mrs. Taylor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being caught, he grinned at her. &ldquo;I reckon husbands are a special kind of
      man,&rdquo; was all that he found to say. &ldquo;Well, since you do know about that,
      it was the next move in the game. Trampas thought I had no call to stop
      him sayin' what he pleased about a woman who was nothin' to me&mdash;then.
      But all women ought to be somethin' to a man. So I had to give Trampas
      another explanation in the presence of folks lookin' on, and it was just
      like the cyards. No ideas occurred to him again. And down goes his opinion
      of me some more!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have not been able to raise it. There has been this and that and
      the other,&mdash;yu' know most of the later doings yourself,&mdash;and
      to-day is the first time I've happened to see the man since the doings
      last autumn. Yu' seem to know about them, too. He knows I can't prove he
      was with that gang of horse thieves. And I can't prove he killed poor
      Shorty. But he knows I missed him awful close, and spoiled his thieving
      for a while. So d' yu' wonder he don't think much of me? But if I had
      lived to be twenty-nine years old like I am, and with all my chances made
      no enemy, I'd feel myself a failure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His story was finished. He had made her his confidant in matters he had
      never spoken of before, and she was happy to be thus much nearer to him.
      It diminished a certain fear that was mingled with her love of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next several miles he was silent, and his silence was enough
      for her. Vermont sank away from her thoughts, and Wyoming held less of
      loneliness. They descended altogether into the map which had stretched
      below them, so that it was a map no longer, but earth with growing things,
      and prairie-dogs sitting upon it, and now and then a bird flying over it.
      And after a while she said to him, &ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been doing sums. Figured in hours it sounds right short. Figured
      in minutes it boils up into quite a mess. Twenty by sixty is twelve
      hundred. Put that into seconds, and yu' get seventy-two thousand seconds.
      Seventy-two thousand. Seventy-two thousand seconds yet before we get
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seconds! To think of its having come to seconds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thinkin' about it. I'm choppin' sixty of 'em off every minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With such chopping time wears away. More miles of the road lay behind
      them, and in the virgin wilderness the scars of new-scraped water ditches
      began to appear, and the first wire fences. Next, they were passing cabins
      and occasional fields, the outposts of habitation. The free road became
      wholly imprisoned, running between unbroken stretches of barbed wire. Far
      off to the eastward a flowing column of dust marked the approaching stage,
      bringing the bishop, probably, for whose visit here they had timed their
      wedding. The day still brimmed with heat and sunshine; but the great daily
      shadow was beginning to move from the feet of the Bow Leg Mountains
      outward toward the town. Presently they began to meet citizens. Some of
      these knew them and nodded, while some did not, and stared. Turning a
      corner into the town's chief street, where stood the hotel, the bank, the
      drug store, the general store, and the seven saloons, they were hailed
      heartily. Here were three friends,&mdash;Honey Wiggin, Scipio Le Moyne,
      and Lin McLean,&mdash;all desirous of drinking the Virginian's health, if
      his lady&mdash;would she mind? The three stood grinning, with their hats
      off; but behind their gayety the Virginian read some other purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll all be very good,&rdquo; said Honey Wiggin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty good,&rdquo; said Lin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Scipio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is the honest man?&rdquo; inquired Molly, glad to see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one!&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;My old friends scare me when I think of
      their ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's bein' engaged scares yu',&rdquo; retorted Mr. McLean. &ldquo;Marriage restores
      your courage, I find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll trust all of you,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;He's going to take me to the
      hotel, and then you can drink his health as much as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a smile to them she turned to proceed, and he let his horse move with
      hers; but he looked at his friends. Then Scipio's bleached blue eyes
      narrowed to a slit, and he said what they had all come out on the street
      to say:&mdash; &ldquo;Don't change your clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; protested Molly, &ldquo;isn't he rather dusty and countrified?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Virginian had taken Scipio's meaning. &ldquo;DON'T CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES.&rdquo;
       Innocent Molly appreciated these words no more than the average reader who
      reads a masterpiece, complacently unaware that its style differs from that
      of the morning paper. Such was Scipio's intention, wishing to spare her
      from alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      So at the hotel she let her lover go with a kiss, and without a thought of
      Trampas. She in her room unlocked the possessions which were there waiting
      for her, and changed her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wedding garments, and other civilized apparel proper for a genuine
      frontiersman when he comes to town, were also in the hotel, ready for the
      Virginian to wear. It is only the somewhat green and unseasoned
      cow-puncher who struts before the public in spurs and deadly weapons. For
      many a year the Virginian had put away these childish things. He made a
      sober toilet for the streets. Nothing but his face and bearing remained
      out of the common when he was in a town. But Scipio had told him not to
      change his clothes; therefore he went out with his pistol at his hip. Soon
      he had joined his three friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm obliged to yu',&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He passed me this mawnin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't know his intentions,&rdquo; said Wiggin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except that he's hangin' around,&rdquo; said McLean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And fillin' up,&rdquo; said Scipio, &ldquo;which reminds me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They strolled into the saloon of a friend, where, unfortunately, sat some
      foolish people. But one cannot always tell how much of a fool a man is, at
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a temperate health-drinking that they made. &ldquo;Here's how,&rdquo; they
      muttered softly to the Virginian; and &ldquo;How,&rdquo; he returned softly, looking
      away from them. But they had a brief meeting of eyes, standing and
      lounging near each other, shyly; and Scipio shook hands with the
      bridegroom. &ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; he stated, tapping himself; for in his vagrant
      heart he began to envy the man who could bring himself to marry. And he
      nodded again, repeating, &ldquo;Here's how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood at the bar, full of sentiment, empty of words, memory and
      affection busy in their hearts. All of them had seen rough days together,
      and they felt guilty with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's hot weather,&rdquo; said Wiggin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hotter on Box Elder,&rdquo; said McLean. &ldquo;My kid has started teething.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Words ran dry again. They shifted their positions, looked in their
      glasses, read the labels on the bottles. They dropped a word now and then
      to the proprietor about his trade, and his ornaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good head,&rdquo; commented McLean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big old ram,&rdquo; assented the proprietor. &ldquo;Shot him myself on Gray Bull last
      fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheep was thick in the Tetons last fall,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the bar stood a machine into which the idle customer might drop his
      nickel. The coin then bounced among an arrangement of pegs, descending at
      length into one or another of various holes. You might win as much as ten
      times your stake, but this was not the most usual result; and with nickels
      the three friends and the bridegroom now mildly sported for a while,
      buying them with silver when their store ran out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it sheep you went after in the Tetons?&rdquo; inquired the proprietor,
      knowing it was horse thieves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;I'll have ten more nickels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get all the sheep you wanted?&rdquo; the proprietor continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor luck,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think there's a friend of yours in town this afternoon,&rdquo; said the
      proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he mention he was my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor laughed. The Virginian watched another nickel click down
      among the pegs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honey Wiggin now made the bridegroom a straight offer. &ldquo;We'll take this
      thing off your hands,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any or all of us,&rdquo; said Lin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Scipio held his peace. His loyalty went every inch as far as theirs,
      but his understanding of his friend went deeper. &ldquo;Don't change your
      clothes,&rdquo; was the first and the last help he would be likely to give in
      this matter. The rest must be as such matters must always be, between man
      and man. To the other two friends, however, this seemed a very special
      case, falling outside established precedent. Therefore they ventured
      offers of interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man don't get married every day,&rdquo; apologized McLean. &ldquo;We'll just run
      him out of town for yu'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save yu' the trouble,&rdquo; urged Wiggin. &ldquo;Say the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor now added his voice. &ldquo;It'll sober him up to spend his night
      out in the brush. He'll quit his talk then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Virginian did not say the word, or any word. He stood playing with
      the nickels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of her,&rdquo; muttered McLean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else would I be thinking of?&rdquo; returned the Southerner. His face had
      become very sombre. &ldquo;She has been raised so different!&rdquo; he murmured. He
      pondered a little, while the others waited, solicitous.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new idea came to the proprietor. &ldquo;I am acting mayor of this town,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;I'll put him in the calaboose and keep him till you get married and
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say the word,&rdquo; repeated Honey Wiggin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scipio's eye met the proprietor's, and he shook his head about a quarter
      of an inch. The proprietor shook his to the same amount. They understood
      each other. It had come to that point where there was no way out, save
      only the ancient, eternal way between man and man. It is only the great
      mediocrity that goes to law in these personal matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he has talked about me some?&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the whiskey,&rdquo; Scipio explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect,&rdquo; said McLean, &ldquo;he'd run a mile if he was in a state to
      appreciate his insinuations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which we are careful not to mention to yu',&rdquo; said Wiggin, &ldquo;unless yu'
      inquire for 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of the fools present had drawn closer to hear this interesting
      conversation. In gatherings of more than six there will generally be at
      least one fool; and this company must have numbered twenty men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This country knows well enough,&rdquo; said one fool, who hungered to be
      important, &ldquo;that you don't brand no calves that ain't your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The saturnine Virginian looked at him. &ldquo;Thank yu',&rdquo; said he, gravely, &ldquo;for
      your indorsement of my character.&rdquo; The fool felt flattered. The Virginian
      turned to his friends. His hand slowly pushed his hat back, and he rubbed
      his black head in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see yu've got your gun with you,&rdquo; continued the happy fool. &ldquo;You
      know what Trampas claims about that affair of yours in the Tetons? He
      claims that if everything was known about the killing of Shorty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take one on the house,&rdquo; suggested the proprietor to him, amiably. &ldquo;Your
      news will be fresher.&rdquo; And he pushed him the bottle. The fool felt less
      important.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This talk had went the rounds before it got to us,&rdquo; said Scipio, &ldquo;or we'd
      have headed it off. He has got friends in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perplexity knotted the Virginian's brows. This community knew that a man
      had implied he was a thief and a murderer; it also knew that he knew it.
      But the case was one of peculiar circumstances, assuredly. Could he avoid
      meeting the man? Soon the stage would be starting south for the railroad.
      He had already to-day proposed to his sweetheart that they should take it.
      Could he for her sake leave unanswered a talking enemy upon the field? His
      own ears had not heard the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into these reflections the fool stepped once more. &ldquo;Of course this country
      don't believe Trampas,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;This country&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he contributed no further thoughts. From somewhere in the rear of the
      building, where it opened upon the tin cans and the hinder purlieus of the
      town, came a movement, and Trampas was among them, courageous with
      whiskey.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the fools now made themselves conspicuous. One lay on the floor,
      knocked there by the Virginian, whose arm he had attempted to hold. Others
      struggled with Trampas, and his bullet smashed the ceiling before they
      could drag the pistol from him. &ldquo;There now! there now!&rdquo; they interposed;
      &ldquo;you don't want to talk like that,&rdquo; for he was pouring out a tide of hate
      and vilification. Yet the Virginian stood quiet by the bar, and many an
      eye of astonishment was turned upon him. &ldquo;I'd not stand half that
      language,&rdquo; some muttered to each other. Still the Virginian waited
      quietly, while the fools reasoned with Trampas. But no earthly foot can
      step between a man and his destiny. Trampas broke suddenly free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friends have saved your life,&rdquo; he rang out, with obscene epithets.
      &ldquo;I'll give you till sundown to leave town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was total silence instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trampas,&rdquo; spoke the Virginian, &ldquo;I don't want trouble with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never has wanted it,&rdquo; Trampas sneered to the bystanders. &ldquo;He has been
      dodging it five years. But I've got him coralled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of the Trampas faction smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trampas,&rdquo; said the Virginian again, &ldquo;are yu' sure yu' really mean that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whiskey bottle flew through the air, hurled by Trampas, and crashed
      through the saloon window behind the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was surplusage, Trampas,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if yu' mean the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out by sundown, that's all,&rdquo; said Trampas. And wheeling, he went out
      of the saloon by the rear, as he had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the Virginian, &ldquo;I know you will all oblige me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; exclaimed the proprietor, heartily, &ldquo;We'll see that everybody lets
      this thing alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian gave a general nod to the company, and walked out into the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a turruble shame,&rdquo; sighed Scipio, &ldquo;that he couldn't have postponed
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian walked in the open air with thoughts disturbed. &ldquo;I am of two
      minds about one thing,&rdquo; he said to himself uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gossip ran in advance of him; but as he came by, the talk fell away until
      he had passed. Then they looked after him, and their words again rose
      audibly. Thus everywhere a little eddy of silence accompanied his steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't trouble him much,&rdquo; one said, having read nothing in the
      Virginian's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may trouble his girl some,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll not know,&rdquo; said a third, &ldquo;until it's over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll not tell her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't. It's no woman's business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe that's so. Well, it would have suited me to have Trampas die
      sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would it suit you to have him live longer?&rdquo; inquired a member of the
      opposite faction, suspected of being himself a cattle thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could answer your question, if I had other folks' calves I wanted to
      brand.&rdquo; This raised both a laugh and a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the town talked, filling in the time before sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian, still walking aloof in the open air, paused at the edge of
      the town. &ldquo;I'd sooner have a sickness than be undecided this way,&rdquo; he
      said, and he looked up and down. Then a grim smile came at his own
      expense. &ldquo;I reckon it would make me sick&mdash;but there's not time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over there in the hotel sat his sweetheart alone, away from her mother,
      her friends, her home, waiting his return, knowing nothing. He looked into
      the west. Between the sun and the bright ridges of the mountains was still
      a space of sky; but the shadow from the mountains' feet had drawn halfway
      toward the town. &ldquo;About forty minutes more,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;She has been
      raised so different.&rdquo; And he sighed as he turned back. As he went slowly,
      he did not know how great was his own unhappiness. &ldquo;She has been raised so
      different,&rdquo; he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite the post-office the bishop of Wyoming met him and greeted him.
      His lonely heart throbbed at the warm, firm grasp of this friend's hand.
      The bishop saw his eyes glow suddenly, as if tears were close. But none
      came, and no word more open than, &ldquo;I'm glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But gossip had reached the bishop, and he was sorely troubled also. &ldquo;What
      is all this?&rdquo; said he, coming straight to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian looked at the clergyman frankly. &ldquo;Yu' know just as much
      about it as I do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I'll tell yu' anything yu' ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you told Miss Wood?&rdquo; inquired the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the bridegroom fell, and the bishop's face grew at once more
      keen and more troubled. Then the bridegroom raised his eyes again, and the
      bishop almost loved him. He touched his arm, like a brother. &ldquo;This is hard
      luck,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridegroom could scarce keep his voice steady. &ldquo;I want to do right
      to-day more than any day I have ever lived,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go and tell her at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will just do nothing but scare her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and tell her at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected you was going to tell me to run away from Trampas. I can't do
      that, yu' know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bishop did know. Never before in all his wilderness work had he faced
      such a thing. He knew that Trampas was an evil in the country, and that
      the Virginian was a good. He knew that the cattle thieves&mdash;the
      rustlers&mdash;were gaining, in numbers and audacity; that they led many
      weak young fellows to ruin; that they elected their men to office, and
      controlled juries; that they were a staring menace to Wyoming. His heart
      was with the Virginian. But there was his Gospel, that he preached, and
      believed, and tried to live. He stood looking at the ground and drawing a
      finger along his eyebrow. He wished that he might have heard nothing about
      all this. But he was not one to blink his responsibility as a Christian
      server of the church militant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I right,&rdquo; he now slowly asked, &ldquo;in believing that you think I am a
      sincere man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe anything about it. I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should run away from Trampas,&rdquo; said the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ain't quite fair, seh. We all understand you have got to do the
      things you tell other folks to do. And you do them, seh. You never talk
      like anything but a man, and you never set yourself above others. You can
      saddle your own horses. And I saw yu' walk unarmed into that White River
      excitement when those two other parsons was a-foggin' and a-fannin' for
      their own safety. Damn scoundrels!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bishop instantly rebuked such language about brothers of his cloth,
      even though he disapproved both of them and their doctrines. &ldquo;Every one
      may be an instrument of Providence,&rdquo; he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Virginian, &ldquo;if that is so, then Providence makes use of
      instruments I'd not touch with a ten-foot pole. Now if you was me, seh,
      and not a bishop, would you run away from Trampas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not quite fair, either!&rdquo; exclaimed the bishop, with a smile.
      &ldquo;Because you are asking me to take another man's convictions, and yet
      remain myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, seh. I am. That's so. That don't get at it. I reckon you and I can't
      get at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Bible,&rdquo; said the bishop, &ldquo;which I believe to be God's word, was
      anything to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is something to me, seh. I have found fine truths in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Thou shalt not kill,'&rdquo; quoted the bishop. &ldquo;That is plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian took his turn at smiling. &ldquo;Mighty plain to me, seh. Make it
      plain to Trampas, and there'll be no killin'. We can't get at it that
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the bishop quoted earnestly. &ldquo;'Vengeance is mine, I will repay,
      saith the Lord.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about instruments of Providence, seh? Why, we can't get at it that
      way. If you start usin' the Bible that way, it will mix you up mighty
      quick, seh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; the bishop urged, and all his good, warm heart was in it, &ldquo;my
      dear fellow&mdash;go away for the one night. He'll change his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian shook his head. &ldquo;He cannot change his word, seh. Or at least
      I must stay around till he does. Why, I have given him the say-so. He's
      got the choice. Most men would not have took what I took from him in the
      saloon. Why don't you ask him to leave town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good bishop was at a standstill. Of all kicking against the pricks
      none is so hard as this kick of a professing Christian against the whole
      instinct of human man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have helped me some,&rdquo; said the Virginian. &ldquo;I will go and tell
      her. At least, if I think it will be good for her, I will tell her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bishop thought that he saw one last chance to move him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're twenty-nine,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a little over,&rdquo; said the Virginian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were fourteen when you ran away from your family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was weary, yu' know, of havin' elder brothers lay down my law
      night and mawnin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. So that your life has been your own for fifteen years. But
      it is not your own now. You have given it to a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I have given it to her. But my life's not the whole of me. I'd give
      her twice my life&mdash;fifty&mdash;a thousand of 'em. But I can't give
      her&mdash;her nor anybody in heaven or earth&mdash;I can't give my&mdash;my&mdash;we'll
      never get at it, seh! There's no good in words. Good-by.&rdquo; The Virginian
      wrung the bishop's hand and left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless him!&rdquo; said the bishop. &ldquo;God bless him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian unlocked the room in the hotel where he kept stored his
      tent, his blankets, his pack-saddles, and his many accoutrements for the
      bridal journey in the mountains. Out of the window he saw the mountains
      blue in shadow, but some cottonwoods distant in the flat between were
      still bright green in the sun. From among his possessions he took quickly
      a pistol, wiping and loading it. Then from its holster he removed the
      pistol which he had tried and made sure of in the morning. This, according
      to his wont when going into a risk, he shoved between his trousers and his
      shirt in front. The untried weapon he placed in the holster, letting it
      hang visibly at his hip. He glanced out of the window again, and saw the
      mountains of the same deep blue. But the cottonwoods were no longer in the
      sunlight. The shadow had come past them, nearer the town; for fifteen of
      the forty minutes were gone. &ldquo;The bishop is wrong,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is no
      sense in telling her.&rdquo; And he turned to the door, just as she came to it
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried out at once, and rushed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swore as he held her close. &ldquo;The fools!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The fools!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been so frightful waiting for you,&rdquo; said she, leaning her head
      against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who had to tell you this?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Somebody just came and said it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is mean luck,&rdquo; he murmured, patting her. &ldquo;This is mean luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on: &ldquo;I wanted to run out and find you; but I didn't! I didn't! I
      stayed quiet in my room till they said you had come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is mean luck. Mighty mean,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you be so long?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Never mind, I've got you now. It
      is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anger and sorrow filled him. &ldquo;I might have known some fool would tell
      you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all over. Never mind.&rdquo; Her arms tightened their hold of him. Then
      she let him go. &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Nothing now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him without understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it is a heap worse for you,&rdquo; he pursued, speaking slowly. &ldquo;I knew
      it would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is over!&rdquo; she exclaimed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not understand her now. He kissed her. &ldquo;Did you think it was over?&rdquo;
       he said simply. &ldquo;There is some waiting still before us. I wish you did not
      have to wait alone. But it will not be long.&rdquo; He was looking down, and did
      not see the happiness grow chilled upon her face, and then fade into
      bewildered fear. &ldquo;I did my best,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I think I did. I know I
      tried. I let him say to me before them all what no man has ever said, or
      ever will again. I kept thinking hard of you&mdash;with all my might, or I
      reckon I'd have killed him right there. And I gave him a show to change
      his mind. I gave it to him twice. I spoke as quiet as I am speaking to you
      now. But he stood to it. And I expect he knows he went too far in the
      hearing of others to go back on his threat. He will have to go on to the
      finish now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The finish?&rdquo; she echoed, almost voiceless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered very gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dilated eyes were fixed upon him. &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; she could scarce form
      utterance, &ldquo;but you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got myself ready,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did you think&mdash;why, what did you
      think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She recoiled a step. &ldquo;What are you going&mdash;&rdquo; She put her two hands to
      her head. &ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; she almost shrieked, &ldquo;you are going&mdash;&rdquo; He made a
      step, and would have put his arm round her, but she backed against the
      wall, staring speechless at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to let him shoot me,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;you mean&mdash;but you can come away!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It's
      not too late yet. You can take yourself out of his reach. Everybody knows
      that you are brave. What is he to you? You can leave him in this place.
      I'll go with you anywhere. To any house, to the mountains, to anywhere
      away. We'll leave this horrible place together and&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
      won't you listen to me?&rdquo; She stretched her hands to him. &ldquo;Won't you
      listen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her hands. &ldquo;I must stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands clung to his. &ldquo;No, no, no. There's something else. There's
      something better than shedding blood in cold blood. Only think what it
      means! Only think of having to remember such a thing! Why, it's what they
      hang people for! It's murder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped her hands. &ldquo;Don't call it that name,&rdquo; he said sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When there was the choice!&rdquo; she exclaimed, half to herself, like a person
      stunned and speaking to the air. &ldquo;To get ready for it when you have the
      choice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did the choosing,&rdquo; answered the Virginian. &ldquo;Listen to me. Are you
      listening?&rdquo; he asked, for her gaze was dull.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I work hyeh. I belong hyeh. It's my life. If folks came to think I was a
      coward&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would think you were a coward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody. My friends would be sorry and ashamed, and my enemies would
      walk around saying they had always said so. I could not hold up my head
      again among enemies or friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it was explained&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There'd be nothing to explain. There'd just be the fact.&rdquo; He was nearly
      angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a higher courage than fear of outside opinion,&rdquo; said the New
      England girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her Southern lover looked at her. &ldquo;Cert'nly there is. That's what I'm
      showing in going against yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you know that you are brave, and if I know that you are brave, oh,
      my dear, my dear! what difference does the world make? How much higher
      courage to go your own course&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am goin' my own course,&rdquo; he broke in. &ldquo;Can't yu' see how it must be
      about a man? It's not for their benefit, friends or enemies, that I have
      got this thing to do. If any man happened to say I was a thief and I heard
      about it, would I let him go on spreadin' such a thing of me? Don't I owe
      my own honesty something better than that? Would I sit down in a corner
      rubbin' my honesty and whisperin' to it, 'There! there! I know you ain't a
      thief?' No, seh; not a little bit! What men say about my nature is not
      just merely an outside thing. For the fact that I let 'em keep on sayin'
      it is a proof I don't value my nature enough to shield it from their
      slander and give them their punishment. And that's being a poor sort of a
      jay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had grown very white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't yu' see how it must be about a man?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; she answered, in a voice that scarcely seemed her own. &ldquo;If I
      ought to, I cannot. To shed blood in cold blood. When I heard about that
      last fall,&mdash;about the killing of those cattle thieves,&mdash;I kept
      saying to myself: 'He had to do it. It was a public duty.' And lying
      sleepless I got used to Wyoming being different from Vermont. But this&mdash;&rdquo;
       she gave a shudder&mdash;&ldquo;when I think of to-morrow, of you and me, and of&mdash;
      If you do this, there can be no to-morrow for you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words he also turned white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;&rdquo; he asked, and could go no farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor could she answer him, but turned her head away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This would be the end?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her head faintly moved to signify yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood still, his hand shaking a little. &ldquo;Will you look at me and say
      that?&rdquo; he murmured at length. She did not move. &ldquo;Can you do it?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sweetness made her turn, but could not pierce her frozen resolve. She
      gazed at him across the great distance of her despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is really so?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lips tried to form words, but failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked out of the window, and saw nothing but shadow. The blue of the
      mountains was now become a deep purple. Suddenly his hand closed hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, then,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that word she was at his feet, clutching him. &ldquo;For my sake,&rdquo; she begged
      him. &ldquo;For my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tremble passed through his frame. She felt his legs shake as she held
      them, and, looking up, she saw that his eyes were closed with misery. Then
      he opened them, and in their steady look she read her answer. He unclasped
      her hands from holding him, and raised her to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no right to kiss you any more,&rdquo; he said. And then, before his
      desire could break him down from this, he was gone, and she was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not fall, or totter, but stood motionless. And next&mdash;it
      seemed a moment and it seemed eternity&mdash;she heard in the distance a
      shot, and then two shots. Out of the window she saw people beginning to
      run. At that she turned and fled to her room, and flung herself face
      downward upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trampas had departed into solitude from the saloon, leaving behind him his
      ULTIMATUM. His loud and public threat was town knowledge already, would
      very likely be county knowledge to-night. Riders would take it with them
      to entertain distant cabins up the river and down the river; and by dark
      the stage would go south with the news of it&mdash;and the news of its
      outcome. For everything would be over by dark. After five years, here was
      the end coming&mdash;coming before dark. Trampas had got up this morning
      with no such thought. It seemed very strange to look back upon the
      morning; it lay so distant, so irrevocable. And he thought of how he had
      eaten his breakfast. How would he eat his supper? For supper would come
      afterward. Some people were eating theirs now, with nothing like this
      before them. His heart ached and grew cold to think of them, easy and
      comfortable with plates and cups of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the mountains, and saw the sun above their ridges, and the
      shadow coming from their feet. And there close behind him was the morning
      he could never go back to. He could see it clearly; his thoughts reached
      out like arms to touch it once more, and be in it again. The night that
      was coming he could not see, and his eyes and his thoughts shrank from it.
      He had given his enemy until sundown. He could not trace the path which
      had led him to this. He remembered their first meeting&mdash;five years
      back, in Medicine Bow, and the words which at once began his hate. No, it
      was before any words; it was the encounter of their eyes. For out of the
      eyes of every stranger looks either a friend or an enemy, waiting to be
      known. But how had five years of hate come to play him such a trick,
      suddenly, to-day? Since last autumn he had meant sometime to get even with
      this man who seemed to stand at every turn of his crookedness, and rob him
      of his spoils. But how had he come to choose such a way of getting even as
      this, face to face? He knew many better ways; and now his own rash
      proclamation had trapped him. His words were like doors shutting him in to
      perform his threat to the letter, with witnesses at hand to see that he
      did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trampas looked at the sun and the shadow again. He had till sundown. The
      heart inside him was turning it round in this opposite way: it was to
      HIMSELF that in his rage he had given this lessening margin of grace. But
      he dared not leave town in all the world's sight after all the world had
      heard him. Even his friends would fall from him after such an act. Could
      he&mdash;the thought actually came to him&mdash;could he strike before the
      time set? But the thought was useless. Even if his friends could harbor
      him after such a deed, his enemies would find him, and his life would be
      forfeit to a certainty. His own trap was closing upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came upon the main street, and saw some distance off the Virginian
      standing in talk with the bishop. He slunk between two houses, and cursed
      both of them. The sight had been good for him, bringing some warmth of
      rage back to his desperate heart. And he went into a place and drank some
      whiskey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your shoes,&rdquo; said the barkeeper, &ldquo;I'd be afraid to take so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the nerves of Trampas were almost beyond the reach of intoxication,
      and he swallowed some more, and went out again. Presently he fell in with
      some of his brothers in cattle stealing, and walked along with them for a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it will not be long now,&rdquo; they said to him. And he had never heard
      words so desolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he made out to say; &ldquo;soon now.&rdquo; Their cheerfulness seemed unearthly
      to him, and his heart almost broke beneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have one to your success,&rdquo; they suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      So with them he repaired to another place; and the sight of a man leaning
      against the bar made him start so that they noticed him. Then he saw that
      the man was a stranger whom he had never laid eyes on till now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looked like Shorty,&rdquo; he said, and could have bitten his tongue off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shorty is quiet up in the Tetons,&rdquo; said a friend. &ldquo;You don't want to be
      thinking about him. Here's how!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they clapped him on the back and he left them. He thought of his
      enemy and his hate, beating his rage like a failing horse, and treading
      the courage of his drink. Across a space he saw Wiggin, walking with
      McLean and Scipio. They were watching the town to see that his friends
      made no foul play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're giving you a clear field,&rdquo; said Wiggin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This race will not be pulled,&rdquo; said McLean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be with you at the finish,&rdquo; said Scipio.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they passed on. They did not seem like real people to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trampas looked at the walls and windows of the houses. Were they real? Was
      he here, walking in this street? Something had changed. He looked
      everywhere, and feeling it everywhere, wondered what this could be. Then
      he knew: it was the sun that had gone entirely behind the mountains, and
      he drew out his pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian, for precaution, did not walk out of the front door of the
      hotel. He went through back ways, and paused once. Against his breast he
      felt the wedding ring where he had it suspended by a chain from his neck.
      His hand went up to it, and he drew it out and looked at it. He took it
      off the chain, and his arm went back to hurl it from him as far as he
      could. But he stopped and kissed it with one sob, and thrust it in his
      pocket. Then he walked out into the open, watching. He saw men here and
      there, and they let him pass as before, without speaking. He saw his three
      friends, and they said no word to him. But they turned and followed in his
      rear at a little distance, because it was known that Shorty had been found
      shot from behind. The Virginian gained a position soon where no one could
      come at him except from in front; and the sight of the mountains was
      almost more than he could endure, because it was there that he had been
      going to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite a while after sunset,&rdquo; he heard himself say.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wind seemed to blow his sleeve off his arm, and he replied to it, and
      saw Trampas pitch forward. He saw Trampas raise his arm from the ground
      and fall again, and lie there this time, still. A little smoke was rising
      from the pistol on the ground, and he looked at his own, and saw the smoke
      flowing upward out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect that's all,&rdquo; he said aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he came nearer Trampas, he covered him with his weapon. He stopped
      a moment, seeing the hand on the ground move. Two fingers twitched, and
      then ceased; for it was all. The Virginian stood looking down at Trampas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of mine hit,&rdquo; he said, once more aloud. &ldquo;His must have gone mighty
      close to my arm. I told her it would not be me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely noticed that he was being surrounded and congratulated.
      His hand was being shaken, and he saw it was Scipio in tears. Scipio's joy
      made his heart like lead within him. He was near telling his friend
      everything, but he did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anybody wants me about this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will be at the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who'll want you?&rdquo; said Scipio. &ldquo;Three of us saw his gun out.&rdquo; And he
      vented his admiration. &ldquo;You were that cool! That quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see you boys again,&rdquo; said the Virginian, heavily; and he walked
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scipio looked after him, astonished. &ldquo;Yu' might suppose he was in poor
      luck,&rdquo; he said to McLean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian walked to the hotel, and stood on the threshold of his
      sweetheart's room. She had heard his step, and was upon her feet. Her lips
      were parted, and her eyes fixed on him, nor did she move, or speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yu' have to know it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have killed Trampas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank God!&rdquo; she said; and he found her in his arms. Long they
      embraced without speaking, and what they whispered then with their kisses,
      matters not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did her New England conscience battle to the end, and, in the end,
      capitulate to love. And the next day, with the bishop's blessing, and Mrs.
      Taylor's broadest smile, and the ring on her finger, the Virginian
      departed with his bride into the mountains.

    <h2>
      XXXVI. AT DUNBARTON
    </h2>
    <p>
      For their first bridal camp he chose an island. Long weeks beforehand he
      had thought of this place, and set his heart upon it. Once established in
      his mind, the thought became a picture that he saw waking and sleeping. He
      had stopped at the island many times alone, and in all seasons; but at
      this special moment of the year he liked it best. Often he had added
      several needless miles to his journey that he might finish the day at this
      point, might catch the trout for his supper beside a certain rock upon its
      edge, and fall asleep hearing the stream on either side of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always for him the first signs that he had gained the true world of the
      mountains began at the island. The first pine trees stood upon it; the
      first white columbine grew in their shade; and it seemed to him that he
      always met here the first of the true mountain air&mdash;the coolness and
      the new fragrance. Below, there were only the cottonwoods, and the knolls
      and steep foot-hills with their sage-brush, and the great warm air of the
      plains; here at this altitude came the definite change. Out of the lower
      country and its air he would urge his horse upward, talking to him aloud,
      and promising fine pasture in a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when at length he had ridden abreast of the island pines, he would
      ford to the sheltered circle of his camp-ground, throw off the saddle and
      blanket from the horse's hot, wet back, throw his own clothes off, and,
      shouting, spring upon the horse bare, and with a rope for bridle, cross
      with him to the promised pasture. Here there was a pause in the mountain
      steepness, a level space of open, green with thick grass. Riding his horse
      to this, he would leap off him, and with the flat of his hand give him a
      blow that cracked sharp in the stillness and sent the horse galloping and
      gambolling to his night's freedom. And while the animal rolled in the
      grass, often his master would roll also, and stretch, and take the grass
      in his two hands, and so draw his body along, limbering his muscles after
      a long ride. Then he would slide into the stream below his fishing place,
      where it was deep enough for swimming, and cross back to his island, and
      dressing again, fit his rod together and begin his casting. After the
      darkness had set in, there would follow the lying drowsily with his head
      upon his saddle, the camp-fire sinking as he watched it, and sleep
      approaching to the murmur of the water on either side of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So many visits to this island had he made, and counted so many hours of
      revery spent in its haunting sweetness, that the spot had come to seem his
      own. It belonged to no man, for it was deep in the unsurveyed and virgin
      wilderness; neither had he ever made his camp here with any man, nor
      shared with any the intimate delight which the place gave him. Therefore
      for many weeks he had planned to bring her here after their wedding, upon
      the day itself, and show her and share with her his pines and his fishing
      rock. He would bid her smell the first true breath of the mountains, would
      watch with her the sinking camp-fire, and with her listen to the water as
      it flowed round the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until this wedding plan, it had by no means come home to him how deep a
      hold upon him the island had taken. He knew that he liked to go there, and
      go alone; but so little was it his way to scan himself, his mind, or his
      feelings (unless some action called for it), that he first learned his
      love of the place through his love of her. But he told her nothing of it.
      After the thought of taking her there came to him, he kept his island as
      something to let break upon her own eyes, lest by looking forward she
      should look for more than the reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, as they rode along, when the houses of the town were shrunk to dots
      behind them, and they were nearing the gates of the foot-hills, she asked
      him questions. She hoped they would find a camp a long way from the town.
      She could ride as many miles as necessary. She was not tired. Should they
      not go on until they found a good place far enough within the solitude?
      Had he fixed upon any? And at the nod and the silence that he gave her for
      reply, she knew that he had thoughts and intentions which she must wait to
      learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed through the gates of the foot-hills, following the stream up
      among them. The outstretching fences and the widely trodden dust were no
      more. Now and then they rose again into view of the fields and houses down
      in the plain below. But as the sum of the miles and hours grew, they were
      glad to see the road less worn with travel, and the traces of men passing
      from sight. The ploughed and planted country, that quilt of many-colored
      harvests which they had watched yesterday, lay in another world from this
      where they rode now. No hand but nature's had sown these crops of yellow
      flowers, these willow thickets and tall cottonwoods. Somewhere in a
      passage of red rocks the last sign of wagon wheels was lost, and after
      this the trail became a wild mountain trail. But it was still the warm air
      of the plains, bearing the sage-brush odor and not the pine, that they
      breathed; nor did any forest yet cloak the shapes of the tawny hills among
      which they were ascending. Twice the steepness loosened the pack ropes,
      and he jumped down to tighten them, lest the horses should get sore backs.
      And twice the stream that they followed went into deep canyons, so that
      for a while they parted from it. When they came back to its margin for the
      second time, he bade her notice how its water had become at last wholly
      clear. To her it had seemed clear enough all along, even in the plain
      above the town. But now she saw that it flowed lustrously with flashes;
      and she knew the soil had changed to mountain soil. Lower down, the water
      had carried the slightest cloud of alkali, and this had dulled the keen
      edge of its transparence. Full solitude was around them now, so that their
      words grew scarce, and when they spoke it was with low voices. They began
      to pass nooks and points favorable for camping, with wood and water at
      hand, and pasture for the horses. More than once as they reached such
      places, she thought he must surely stop; but still he rode on in advance
      of her (for the trail was narrow) until, when she was not thinking of it,
      he drew rein and pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pines,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked, and saw the island, and the water folding it with ripples and
      with smooth spaces. The sun was throwing upon the pine boughs a light of
      deepening red gold, and the shadow of the fishing rock lay over a little
      bay of quiet water and sandy shore. In this forerunning glow of the
      sunset, the pasture spread like emerald; for the dry touch of summer had
      not yet come near it. He pointed upward to the high mountains which they
      had approached, and showed her where the stream led into their first
      unfoldings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow we shall be among them,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she murmured to him, &ldquo;to-night is here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded for answer, and she gazed at the island and understood why he
      had not stopped before; nothing they had passed had been so lovely as this
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was room in the trail for them to go side by side; and side by side
      they rode to the ford and crossed, driving the packhorses in front of
      them, until they came to the sheltered circle, and he helped her down
      where the soft pine needles lay. They felt each other tremble, and for a
      moment she stood hiding her head upon his breast. Then she looked round at
      the trees, and the shores, and the flowing stream, and he heard her
      whispering how beautiful it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; he said, still holding her. &ldquo;This is how I have dreamed it
      would happen. Only it is better than my dreams.&rdquo; And when she pressed him
      in silence, he finished, &ldquo;I have meant we should see our first sundown
      here, and our first sunrise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wished to help him take the packs from their horses, to make the camp
      together with him, to have for her share the building of the fire, and the
      cooking. She bade him remember his promise to her that he would teach her
      how to loop and draw the pack-ropes, and the swing-ropes on the
      pack-saddles, and how to pitch a tent. Why might not the first lesson be
      now? But he told her that this should be fulfilled later. This night he
      was to do all himself. And he sent her away until he should have camp
      ready for them. He bade her explore the island, or take her horse and ride
      over to the pasture, where she could see the surrounding hills and the
      circle of seclusion that they made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole world is far from here,&rdquo; he said. And so she obeyed him, and
      went away to wander about in their hiding-place; nor was she to return, he
      told her, until he called her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then at once, as soon as she was gone, he fell to. The packs and saddles
      came off the horses, which he turned loose upon the pasture on the main
      land. The tent was unfolded first. He had long seen in his mind where it
      should go, and how its white shape would look beneath the green of the
      encircling pines. The ground was level in the spot he had chosen, without
      stones or roots, and matted with the fallen needles of the pines. If there
      should come any wind, or storm of rain, the branches were thick overhead,
      and around them on three sides tall rocks and undergrowth made a barrier.
      He cut the pegs for the tent, and the front pole, stretching and
      tightening the rope, one end of it pegged down and one round a pine tree.
      When the tightening rope had lifted the canvas to the proper height from
      the ground, he spread and pegged down the sides and back, leaving the
      opening so that they could look out upon the fire and a piece of the
      stream beyond. He cut tufts of young pine and strewed them thickly for a
      soft floor in the tent, and over them spread the buffalo hide and the
      blankets. At the head he placed the neat sack of her belongings. For his
      own he made a shelter with crossed poles and a sheet of canvas beyond the
      first pines. He built the fire where its smoke would float outward from
      the trees and the tent, and near it he stood the cooking things and his
      provisions, and made this first supper ready in the twilight. He had
      brought much with him; but for ten minutes he fished, catching trout
      enough. When at length she came riding over the stream at his call, there
      was nothing for her to do but sit and eat at the table he had laid. They
      sat together, watching the last of the twilight and the gentle oncoming of
      the dusk. The final after-glow of day left the sky, and through the purple
      which followed it came slowly the first stars, bright and wide apart. They
      watched the spaces between them fill with more stars, while near them the
      flames and embers of their fire grew brighter. Then he sent her to the
      tent while he cleaned the dishes and visited the horses to see that they
      did not stray from the pasture. Some while after the darkness was fully
      come, he rejoined her. All had been as he had seen it in his thoughts
      beforehand: the pines with the setting sun upon them, the sinking
      camp-fire, and now the sound of the water as it flowed murmuring by the
      shores of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tent opened to the east, and from it they watched together their first
      sunrise. In his thoughts he had seen this morning beforehand also: the
      waking, the gentle sound of the water murmuring ceaselessly, the growing
      day, the vision of the stream, the sense that the world was shut away far
      from them. So did it all happen, except that he whispered to her again:&mdash;
      &ldquo;Better than my dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They saw the sunlight begin upon a hilltop; and presently came the sun
      itself, and lakes of warmth flowed into the air, slowly filling the green
      solitude. Along the island shores the ripples caught flashes from the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going into the stream,&rdquo; he said to her; and rising, he left her in
      the tent. This was his side of the island, he had told her last night; the
      other was hers, where he had made a place for her to bathe. When he was
      gone, she found it, walking through the trees and rocks to the water's
      edge. And so, with the island between them, the two bathed in the cold
      stream. When he came back, he found her already busy at their camp. The
      blue smoke of the fire was floating out from the trees, loitering
      undispersed in the quiet air, and she was getting their breakfast. She had
      been able to forestall him because he had delayed long at his dressing,
      not willing to return to her unshaven. She looked at his eyes that were
      clear as the water he had leaped into, and at his soft silk neckerchief,
      knotted with care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not let us ever go away from here!&rdquo; she cried, and ran to him as he
      came. They sat long together at breakfast, breathing the morning breath of
      the earth that was fragrant with woodland moisture and with the pines.
      After the meal he could not prevent her helping him make everything clean.
      Then, by all customs of mountain journeys, it was time they should break
      camp and be moving before the heat of the day. But first, they delayed for
      no reason, save that in these hours they so loved to do nothing. And next,
      when with some energy he got upon his feet and declared he must go and
      drive the horses in, she asked, Why? Would it not be well for him to fish
      here, that they might be sure of trout at their nooning? And though he
      knew that where they should stop for noon, trout would be as sure as here,
      he took this chance for more delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went with him to his fishing rock, and sat watching him. The rock was
      tall, higher than his head when he stood. It jutted out halfway across the
      stream, and the water flowed round it in quick foam, and fell into a pool.
      He caught several fish; but the sun was getting high, and after a time it
      was plain the fish had ceased to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet still he stood casting in silence, while she sat by and watched him.
      Across the stream, the horses wandered or lay down in their pasture. At
      length he said with half a sigh that perhaps they ought to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought?&rdquo; she repeated softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we are to get anywhere to-day,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Need we get anywhere?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her question sent delight through him like a flood. &ldquo;Then you do not want
      to move camp to-day?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this he laid down his rod and came and sat by her. &ldquo;I am very glad we
      shall not go till to-morrow,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-morrow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Nor next day. Nor any day until we must.&rdquo; And
      she stretched her hands out to the island and the stream exclaiming,
      &ldquo;Nothing can surpass this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her in his arms. &ldquo;You feel about it the way I do,&rdquo; he almost
      whispered. &ldquo;I could not have hoped there'd be two of us to care so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently, while they remained without speaking by the pool, came a little
      wild animal swimming round the rock from above. It had not seen them, nor
      suspected their presence. They held themselves still, watching its alert
      head cross through the waves quickly and come down through the pool, and
      so swim to the other side. There it came out on a small stretch of sand,
      turned its gray head and its pointed black nose this way and that, never
      seeing them, and then rolled upon its back in the warm dry sand. After a
      minute of rolling, it got on its feet again, shook its fur, and trotted
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the bridegroom husband opened his shy heart deep down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am like that fellow,&rdquo; he said dreamily. &ldquo;I have often done the same.&rdquo;
       And stretching slowly his arms and legs, he lay full length upon his back,
      letting his head rest upon her. &ldquo;If I could talk his animal language, I
      could talk to him,&rdquo; he pursued. &ldquo;And he would say to me: 'Come and roll on
      the sands. Where's the use of fretting? What's the gain in being a man?
      Come roll on the sands with me.' That's what he would say.&rdquo; The Virginian
      paused. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;the trouble is, I am responsible. If that
      could only be forgot forever by you and me!&rdquo; Again he paused and went on,
      always dreamily. &ldquo;Often when I have camped here, it has made me want to
      become the ground, become the water, become the trees, mix with the whole
      thing. Not know myself from it. Never unmix again. Why is that?&rdquo; he
      demanded, looking at her. &ldquo;What is it? You don't know, nor I don't. I
      wonder would everybody feel that way here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not everybody,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; none except the ones who understand things they can't put words to.
      But you did!&rdquo; He put up a hand and touched her softly. &ldquo;You understood
      about this place. And that's what makes it&mdash;makes you and me as we
      are now&mdash;better than my dreams. And my dreams were pretty good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed with supreme quiet and happiness, and seemed to stretch his
      length closer to the earth. And so he lay, and talked to her as he had
      never talked to any one, not even to himself. Thus she learned secrets of
      his heart new to her: his visits here, what they were to him, and why he
      had chosen it for their bridal camp. &ldquo;What I did not know at all,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;was the way a man can be pining for&mdash;for this&mdash;and never
      guess what is the matter with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished talking, still he lay extended and serene; and she
      looked down at him and the wonderful change that had come over him, like a
      sunrise. Was this dreamy boy the man of two days ago? It seemed a distance
      immeasurable; yet it was two days only since that wedding eve when she had
      shrunk from him as he stood fierce and implacable. She could look back at
      that dark hour now, although she could not speak of it. She had seen
      destruction like sharp steel glittering in his eyes. Were these the same
      eyes? Was this youth with his black head of hair in her lap the creature
      with whom men did not trifle, whose hand knew how to deal death? Where had
      the man melted away to in this boy? For as she looked at him, he might
      have been no older than nineteen to-day. Not even at their first meeting&mdash;that
      night when his freakish spirit was uppermost&mdash;had he looked so young.
      This change their hours upon the island had wrought, filling his face with
      innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by they made their nooning. In the afternoon she would have
      explored the nearer woods with him, or walked up the stream. But since
      this was to be their camp during several days, he made it more complete.
      He fashioned a rough bench and a table; around their tent he built a tall
      wind-break for better shelter in case of storm; and for the fire he
      gathered and cut much wood, and piled it up. So they were provided for,
      and so for six days and nights they stayed, finding no day or night long
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once his hedge of boughs did them good service, for they had an afternoon
      of furious storm. The wind rocked the pines and ransacked the island, the
      sun went out, the black clouds rattled, and white bolts of lightning fell
      close by. The shower broke through the pine branches and poured upon the
      tent. But he had removed everything inside from where it could touch the
      canvas and so lead the water through, and the rain ran off into the ditch
      he had dug round the tent. While they sat within, looking out upon the
      bounding floods and the white lightning, she saw him glance at her
      apprehensively, and at once she answered his glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not afraid,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If a flame should consume us together now,
      what would it matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so they sat watching the storm till it was over, he with his face
      changed by her to a boy's, and she leavened with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last they were compelled to leave the island, or see no more of
      the mountains, it was not a final parting. They would come back for the
      last night before their journey ended. Furthermore, they promised each
      other like two children to come here every year upon their wedding day,
      and like two children they believed that this would be possible. But in
      after years they did come, more than once, to keep their wedding day upon
      the island, and upon each new visit were able to say to each other,
      &ldquo;Better than our dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For thirty days by the light of the sun and the camp-fire light they saw
      no faces except their own; and when they were silent it was all stillness,
      unless the wind passed among the pines, or some flowing water was near
      them. Sometimes at evening they came upon elk, or black-tailed deer,
      feeding out in the high parks of the mountains; and once from the edge of
      some concealing timber he showed her a bear, sitting with an old log
      lifted in its paws. She forbade him to kill the bear, or any creature that
      they did not require. He took her upward by trail and canyon, through the
      unfooted woods and along dwindling streams to their headwaters, lakes
      lying near the summit of the range, full of trout, with meadows of long
      grass and a thousand flowers, and above these the pinnacles of rock and
      snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made their camps in many places, delaying several days here, and one
      night there, exploring the high solitudes together, and sinking deep in
      their romance. Sometimes when he was at work with their horses, or intent
      on casting his brown hackle for a fish, she would watch him with eyes that
      were fuller of love than of understanding. Perhaps she never came wholly
      to understand him; but in her complete love for him she found enough. He
      loved her with his whole man's power. She had listened to him tell her in
      words of transport, &ldquo;I could enjoy dying&rdquo;; yet she loved him more than
      that. He had come to her from a smoking pistol, able to bid her farewell&mdash;and
      she could not let him go. At the last white-hot edge of ordeal, it was she
      who renounced, and he who had his way. Nevertheless she found much more
      than enough, in spite of the sigh that now and again breathed through her
      happiness when she would watch him with eyes fuller of love than of
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could not speak of that grim wedding eve for a long while after; but
      the mountains brought them together upon all else in the world and their
      own lives. At the end they loved each other doubly more than at the
      beginning, because of these added confidences which they exchanged and
      shared. It was a new bliss to her to know a man's talk and thoughts, to be
      given so much of him; and to him it was a bliss still greater to melt from
      that reserve his lonely life had bred in him. He never would have guessed
      so much had been stored away in him, unexpressed till now. They did not
      want to go to Vermont and leave these mountains, but the day came when
      they had to turn their backs upon their dream. So they came out into the
      plains once more, well established in their familiarity, with only the
      journey still lying between themselves and Bennington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could,&rdquo; she said, laughing. &ldquo;If only you could ride home like
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Monte and my six-shooter?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;To your mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think mother could resist the way you look on a horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he said, &ldquo;It's this way she's fearing I will come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made one discovery,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are fonder of good clothes
      than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grinned. &ldquo;I cert'nly like 'em. But don't tell my friends. They would
      say it was marriage. When you see what I have got for Bennington's special
      benefit, you&mdash;why, you'll just trust your husband more than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She undoubtedly did. After he had put on one particular suit, she arose
      and kissed him where he stood in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bennington will be sorrowful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No wild-west show, after all.
      And no ready-made guy, either.&rdquo; And he looked at himself in the glass with
      unbidden pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you choose that?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;How did you know that homespun was
      exactly the thing for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I have been noticing. I used to despise an Eastern man because his
      clothes were not Western. I was very young then, or maybe not so very
      young, as very&mdash;as what you saw I was when you first came to Bear
      Creek. A Western man is a good thing. And he generally knows that. But he
      has a heap to learn. And he generally don't know that. So I took to
      watching the Judge's Eastern visitors. There was that Mr. Ogden
      especially, from New Yawk&mdash;the gentleman that was there the time when
      I had to sit up all night with the missionary, yu' know. His clothes
      pleased me best of all. Fit him so well, and nothing flash. I got my
      ideas, and when I knew I was going to marry you, I sent my measure East&mdash;and
      I and the tailor are old enemies now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bennington probably was disappointed. To see get out of the train merely a
      tall man with a usual straw hat, and Scotch homespun suit of a rather
      better cut than most in Bennington&mdash;this was dull. And his
      conversation&mdash;when he indulged in any&mdash;seemed fit to come inside
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Flynt took her revenge by sowing broadcast her thankfulness that poor
      Sam Bannett had been Molly's rejected suitor. He had done so much better
      for himself. Sam had married a rich Miss Van Scootzer, of the second
      families of Troy; and with their combined riches this happy couple still
      inhabit the most expensive residence in Hoosic Falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      But most of Bennington soon began to say that Molly's cow-boy could be
      invited anywhere and hold his own. The time came when they ceased to speak
      of him as a cow-boy, and declared that she had shown remarkable sense. But
      this was not quite yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did this bride and groom enjoy their visit to her family? Well&mdash;well,
      they did their best. Everybody did their best, even Sarah Bell. She said
      that she found nothing to object to in the Virginian; she told Molly so.
      Her husband Sam did better than that. He told Molly he considered that she
      was in luck. And poor Mrs. Wood, sitting on the sofa, conversed
      scrupulously and timidly with her novel son-in-law, and said to Molly that
      she was astonished to find him so gentle. And he was undoubtedly
      fine-looking; yes, very handsome. She believed that she would grow to like
      the Southern accent. Oh, yes! Everybody did their best; and, dear reader,
      if ever it has been your earthly portion to live with a number of people
      who were all doing their best, you do not need me to tell you what a
      heavenly atmosphere this creates.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the bride and groom went to see the old great-aunt over at
      Dunbarton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their first arrival, the one at Bennington, had been thus: Sam Bell had
      met them at the train, and Mrs. Wood, waiting in her parlor, had embraced
      her daughter and received her son-in-law. Among them they had managed to
      make the occasion as completely mournful as any family party can be, with
      the window blinds up. &ldquo;And with you present, my dear,&rdquo; said Sam Bell to
      Sarah, &ldquo;the absence of a coffin was not felt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at Dunbarton the affair went off differently. The heart of the ancient
      lady had taught her better things. From Bennington to Dunbarton is the
      good part of a day's journey, and they drove up to the gate in the
      afternoon. The great-aunt was in her garden, picking some August flowers,
      and she called as the carriage stopped, &ldquo;Bring my nephew here, my dear,
      before you go into the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, Molly, stepping out of the carriage, squeezed her husband's hand.
      &ldquo;I knew that she would be lovely,&rdquo; she whispered to him. And then she ran
      to her aunt's arms, and let him follow. He came slowly, hat in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady advanced to meet him, trembling a little, and holding out her
      hand to him. &ldquo;Welcome, nephew,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What a tall fellow you are, to
      be sure. Stand off, sir, and let me look at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Virginian obeyed, blushing from his black hair to his collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his new relative turned to her niece, and gave her a flower. &ldquo;Put
      this in his coat, my dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I think I understand why you
      wanted to marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this the maid came and showed them to their rooms. Left alone in her
      garden, the great-aunt sank on a bench and sat there for some time; for
      emotion had made her very weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs, Molly, sitting on the Virginian's knee, put the flower in his
      coat, and then laid her head upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know old ladies could be that way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;D' yu' reckon
      there are many?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I'm so happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now at tea, and during the evening, the great-aunt carried out her plans
      still further. At first she did the chief part of the talking herself. Nor
      did she ask questions about Wyoming too soon. She reached that in her own
      way, and found out the one thing that she desired to know. It was through
      General Stark that she led up to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; she said, showing the family portrait. &ldquo;And a rough time he
      must have had of it now and then. New Hampshire was full of fine young men
      in those days. But nowadays most of them have gone away to seek their
      fortunes in the West. Do they find them, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am. All the good ones do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you cannot all be&mdash;what is the name?&mdash;Cattle Kings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's having its day, ma'am, right now. And we are getting ready for the
      change&mdash;some of us are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what may be the change, and when is it to come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the natural pasture is eaten off,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I have seen that
      coming a long while. And if the thieves are going to make us drive our
      stock away, we'll drive it. If they don't, we'll have big pastures fenced,
      and hay and shelter ready for winter. What we'll spend in improvements,
      we'll more than save in wages. I am well fixed for the new conditions. And
      then, when I took up my land, I chose a place where there is coal. It will
      not be long before the new railroad needs that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus the old lady learned more of her niece's husband in one evening than
      the Bennington family had ascertained during his whole sojourn with them.
      For by touching upon Wyoming and its future, she roused him to talk. He
      found her mind alive to Western questions: irrigation, the Indians, the
      forests; and so he expanded, revealing to her his wide observation and his
      shrewd intelligence. He forgot entirely to be shy. She sent Molly to bed,
      and kept him talking for an hour. Then she showed him old things that she
      was proud of, &ldquo;because,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we, too, had something to do with
      making our country. And now go to Molly, or you'll both think me a
      tiresome old lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think&mdash;&rdquo; he began, but was not quite equal to expressing what he
      thought, and suddenly his shyness flooded him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, nephew,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I'm afraid you'll have to kiss me good
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so she dismissed him to his wife, and to happiness greater than either
      of them had known since they had left the mountains and come to the East.
      &ldquo;He'll do,&rdquo; she said to herself, nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their visit to Dunbarton was all happiness and reparation for the doleful
      days at Bennington. The old lady gave much comfort and advice to her niece
      in private, and when they came to leave, she stood at the front door
      holding both their hands a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, my dears,&rdquo; she told them. &ldquo;And when you come next time,
      I'll have the nursery ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it happened that before she left this world, the great-aunt was
      able to hold in her arms the first of their many children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Henry at Sunk Creek had his wedding present ready. His growing
      affairs in Wyoming needed his presence in many places distant from his
      ranch, and he made the Virginian his partner. When the thieves prevailed
      at length, as they did, forcing cattle owners to leave the country or be
      ruined, the Virginian had forestalled this crash. The herds were driven
      away to Montana. Then, in 1889, came the cattle war, when, after putting
      their men in office, and coming to own some of the newspapers, the thieves
      brought ruin on themselves as well. For in a broken country there is
      nothing left to steal.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the railroad came, and built a branch to that land of the Virginian's
      where the coal was. By that time he was an important man, with a strong
      grip on many various enterprises, and able to give his wife all and more
      than she asked or desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes she missed the Bear Creek days, when she and he had ridden
      together, and sometimes she declared that his work would kill him. But it
      does not seem to have done so. Their eldest boy rides the horse Monte;
      and, strictly between ourselves, I think his father is going to live a
      long while.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
